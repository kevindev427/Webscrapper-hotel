"Beautifull colonial hotel on the beach, full of historical moments of Colombo, bar and dining are amazing and just to have a breakfast in the terrasse is already a unique experience, I travel all around the world and my stay in Gale Face was fantastic. Congrats."
"The wooden architecture is really beautiful and the staff is really friendly. ,Good location and closer to the beach and other local shopping areas. ,These days since the terror attacks the security is a bit high but no complains because those things are really essential for security purpose."
"The rooms are exquisite with two cleankngcservices per day.The location is on the bay and by sleep with the sound of crashing waves in your ears. Staff and food are amazing. A must visit hotel for personal care . You are family, not a guest "
Went to Galle Face hotel to grab a quick bite and some drinks with family. Look for Malinda @ king of mambo. Great service had a pleasant time dining on a fine day out facing the ocean at open terrace
"This hotel is significant not only for its location but also its place in history. The museum will boast of Prince Philip's car and also a listing of renewed personalities around the world who have walked and stayed inside its walls. I visited to attend a meeting at the back wing where the museum is located. Their service was impeccable and the afternoon tea selection of sandwiches and cakes were delectable. The views from the beach were fantastic, they also have a flag retreat where bagpipes play at sundown. Best place to be when the sun sets."
Final night of a tour was the highlight. Could not have asked for better service including a late checkout and being looked after right up until the car picked us up. The flag ceremony at the going down of the sun was especially poignant and very British. Cocktails on the lawn were relaxing.
"The best place to stay hands down in Colombo. ,From the moment we arrived the service and friendliness of this lovely historic hotel was amazing.,We were there with a very large conference some 300 people. Nothing was too much trouble.,Do yourself a favour and go to Sri Lanka and stay at Galle Face.,It is not to be missed."
I am extremely disappointed with the management of the hotel. We meant to check in on Easter Sunday 21/4/19. As you all know Sri Lanka was shaken by a string of terrorist attacks that morning. We were advised not to move hotels and stay in put. The taxi service wasn’t working in the hotel we were staying in as a result of the attacks as they said it was not safe to go out. We have called the hotel and asked if they could send us a taxi to transport us to the hotel (which obviously we would pay for) they told us they can’t as their transportation service isn’t running as well due to the terrorist attacks. I told them if that’s the case there is no way that we can check in. However after 3 days they took the payment from my card. I have contacted Booking.com as I have booked through them and being on the phone for over 50mins the lady told me the hotel is refusing to refund the money as they marked us as ‘no show’. I found it disgusting that they are still trying to make money out of the unfortunate situation. It’s very sad.
"We love this place the staff are amazing it is very well priced for a fabulous grand hotel and I highly recommend this for anyone who wants a great Sea view,We have been here during this time of the ,Bombing but the security is incredible and ,The staff here have been very diligent and make us feel very safe"
"Beautiful, colonial hotel by the ocean front. Lovely big, salt water pool overlooking the ocean (no ocean swimming allowed). Beach front local markets are a one minute walk from the hotel and a tuk tuk into central Colombo is not more than 5 or 10 minutes (depending where you are going; recommend using Uber as it can be used to book tuk tuks). Amazing breakfast selection. Wonderful staff. "
