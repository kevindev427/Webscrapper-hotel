We arrived about 7.30 am and there were already lots of people there! It is definitely worth getting there early as it is cooler and less crowds. We came down about 9am and it was very hot and very crowded.
Arrived around 9am with a guide. Lots of people but did not feel crowded. The grounds before the actual climb are magnificent and the history is fascinating. The entire climb around and up to the top is not too difficult. My husband has bad knees and managed most of the climb missing the last push to the top. There were people clearly nervous about heights and having to push themselves to the top but it is very achievable. Yes it was hot but only what we expected and manageable. This magnificent palace is carved out of granite and is truely something you will not want to miss. A must do.
"Sigiriya is the home of Lion Rock, a 200 m high rock and the site of a 5th-century palace and kingdom. Formed out of the magma of an extinct volcano, King Kasyapa chose the rock as a site for his palace and indeed his own kingdom. ﻿﻿The ancient rock palace has some very unique frescoes that are incredibly well-preserved considering they are more than 1,500 years old and at the plateau, you will find the beautiful gardens of Sigiriya, which are among the oldest landscaped gardens in the world."
There are no words for this place.  Only suggestion is to look at what the palace looked like before so when there you can use your imagination.
"Just as well we left at 7am in the morning, the steeps were fairly steep so not for the faint hearted.  Well worth being at the top but exhausting getting there."
This was a great experience and definitely worth doing. The views were spectacular and the history of Sigiriya is so interesting.
"We arrived at the museum at 07:00 as it opened to purchase tickets. We then went straight to the complex and started the climb to the summit. It was incredible, but I am scared of heights and it really pushed me. Everything was well coordinated and staffed. After exploring the summit we came back down and explored the rest of the ruins, then went to the museum which was very informative. "
We managed to do the hike and it took us about 45 minutes to reach the top. Lots of Tourist come here to visit the Sigiriya. There is a fee that needs to be paid at the entrance. We didn't take the tour guides but just followed the trail on the map provided. If you are a person that is afraid of height dont go there.
"The ancient city of Sigiriya was top of my list for things to do in Sri Lanka and maybe because of the expectation I was perhaps a little dissapointed by the hoardes of people visting, even first thing in the morning. That said, its still a five star and a must see in Sri Lanka and despite the steep entrance fee."
"This is a beautiful place. If you want to go to the top of this old fortress you have to climb over 1000 stepts.It`s not that hard, but it is very hot outside, so try and go early in the moring of at evening to see the sunset. And also, there are a lot of monkeys up there."
We visited early in the morning to avoid the heat. 
"We visited on a hot & humid morning and along with our allocated guide, were soon joined by another guide who offered to help my wife up the stairs. This was appreciated at the time as my wife was struggling with a painful knee. The experience is well worth the effort & the information provided by our guide was valuable in appreciating the site. Once at the top we thanked the second guide & offered him a 500 rupee tip. He said this was not acceptable and demanded a 2000 rupee tip. After returning to the bottom I offered our second guide a 2000 rupee tip but he said 3000 was his price. We never paid this much in tips any where else during our 2 weeks in Sri Lanka & found the guides at the Ancient Rock to be greedy & rude. Be sure to negotiate the tip before your tour starts."
"Yes, the view is great, there's a lion paw and some brick walls on the top. You need to try hard to imagine what those buildings could be once. Why is the mirror wall is called mirror??? It is just a yellow painted wall. Overall, it does not worth usd 30. Go to next hill Pidurangala for lkr 500. It's just too expensive for what you get."
Excellent plea wonderful UNESCO died and good view I'm recommend sigrya rook    good people waking buteful images
"The best ancient experience how a king has lived inside a Huge Massive Rock with all the Srilankan Paintings inside,
Really enjoyed visiting the World Unesco Heritage Site in Srilanka"
We climbed Lion Rock in the early morning (7 am) which was a good idea as the heat can be very taxing. I am 75 and have had coronary artery stents 12 months ago. The trail up was reasonably steep with many steps but many rest areas possible. When we reached the staging area for the ladders (the Lion’s paw) I was surprised that we were so close to the summit. The ladders are steep but safe. However if you are scared of heights do not do the final section as there is a shear drop that looks startling. Great views from the top and fascinating ruins. 
"Amazing history, paintings, architecture, techniques and view. Great place for every travelers who are able to climb. Other can wait down."
"As a lot of tour company’s seem to have cancelled their tours, there weren’t many people at Sigiriya when we climbed in the afternoon, maybe 20 people. Make sure you have time to explore the grounds after you climb by following the signs that go to the car park. We found that more interesting than the actual climb. It’s a beautiful area. When we came down there weren’t any tuk tuks around (perhaps a sign of less tourists) so we walked to our nearby hotel (beware of snakes and elephants if you have to do the same)."
Being 65 with arthritic knees I found going down to be more difficult that going up. It was 32 degrees with high humidity so that added to the degree of difficulty. However if you take your time and keep your fluids up it is certainly achievable. There are some grand views going up and the view from the top is magnificent. If it is physically possible for you to do the climb then do it.
"It was good, the best time to visit Sigiriya is as early as 6.30 am, when the sun is not hot & before the big local crowds come in or in the evening around 3.00 pm when the sin is going down."
Magical place. A very beautiful view from the hill. I recommend going Up. One of many obligatory places on Ceylon.
"Everybody tried to put us off climbing to the top. All the advice was that we should do it only in the early morning and when it wasn't so crowded. Needless to say we didn't have any choice as we were there at midday on a public holiday. It was hot, crowded and difficult (I found the first bit up the stone steps much harder than the bit after the Lions Paws where at least there was a handrail), but it was worth all the effort. Magnificent views!! Just don't believe that the local people are going to be polite and queue quietly. They push and shove you all the way and cut you up when they get the chance. They even tread on you to get in front. But there's never any rancour and they do it with a smile - and they don't seem to mind if you push and shove right back. In fact, be wary of anyone who extends a helping hand. They want money!"
"Must go of Sigiriya!
Very hot and very crowdy, you should go early in a morning
Dont forget to bring your water to the top
Stay away from the cheeky monkies :-)"
"Lots of beautiful nature. Climbing up is not easy, but I think it is possible to reach the top of every person. The most important thing is not to rush. We are not fast, just a little bit rested. The most important thing is to have water. Beautiful panoramic views can be seen from the top. From the top of the hill we landed down quickly, as it was easy to get down."
I arrived relatively early around 8:30am and purchased a ticket there. There weren’t any queues really which was great. I did this on my own with no guide and really enjoyed it. I do think a guide may have given me a bit more knowledge of the place though. It was busy and the climb was hot! The views are absolutely out of this world. I would highly recommend this experience if you are in srilanka.
Worth getting up early to do this climb both for the heat and for the number of people passing on the staircase going up the side of the rock. I'd prepared myself for a much longer climb but reached the top quicker than i thought. We had a guide who told us some interesting information but it's not necessary. The views in all directions are spectacular. We left our hotel at 6am and were back having breakfast by 9.30. Lots of savvy monkeys around so hang on to your valuables!
It is a beautiful site initially approaching the rock through the ponds. You can imagine what it was like when the empire was at its heights. Once you reach the base of the rock its then a easy walk up the the wall of mirrors. Once you reach the Lion's Paw there is a plateau where you get some fantastic views and a good rest stop - then its a vertical stair climb up to the top of the rock. This was the toughest part mainly due to the heat and crowds (it was mid morning) Once you reach the top of the rock you are rewarded with a beautiful view of the surrounding area - well worth the climb up!
"Amazing experience, worth the climb. So much history in this area. Enjoyed the museum tour before to explain the site and its history and significance for Sri Lanka."
In title itself I mentioned both sides of the place.
Just do it. Get over the height and climb to see one of the great sights. Either the build was genius or folly but either way amazing
"I have recently visited sigiriya rock. It was impressive with lots of things to see (gardens, caves etc), however I feel the toughness of the climb gets played down slightly. The steps really are tough, especially the last section. I am great with heights and even I was starting to get a bit wobbly towards the top. When you get to the top the views are worth it. We set off early and got there about 8.15, by the time we got to the top it was 35 degrees and only 9.30 in the morning. I would suggest going as early as possible to avoid the heat and crowds. The crowds were fine at the time we went. One final thing. At the lion feet location, if you decide not to proceed to the top there is an open area with water to wait. This area seemed quite busy (people"
"The other being the Blue Whale we saw, so this is a high bar! Physically beautiful and historically fascinating must-see. Recommend visiting very early in the morning - it is worth an early wake-up to get to the top with a handful of people and not have to snake up the steep stairs with an endless crowd in the hot sun."
Our guide did tell us that to climb the rock in the morning is easier but it's busier as more tourists do the morning climb.
Its a must visit place in Sri Lanka. It is also UNESCO's world heritage site. Once you go there you should climb to the top as the views on the way is amazing seeing all beautiful nature and amazing Sri Lanka. Please take water with you and also try to go in the morning.
"The rock fortress, Ancient City of Sigiriya, is not only iconic because it is UNESCO heritage, but also because of its beautiful history. If you get a chance do read about King Visthavasa and his empire. The frescos that adorn the walls and the architecture are still considered a marvel. "
One of the best in Sri Lanka. I invite ppls to visit this place if not visited. And also make sure you go early  in the morning  so that sun will not be an issue at all.
"We got up early to climb Lion Rock and we're very glad we did! Although we arrived a little late because of an elephant-in-the-road situation! A lovely array of gardens and ponds flank the path that leads towards the start of the walk. There are quite a few stairs, so I'd probably recommend decent shoes - but it wasn't as hard as we were expecting. Doing it early meant that the majority of the path up the rock was in it's shade. Great views of the surrounding area at the top,but not much shade so you can't spend more than about 30 mins there. "
"I was in Sri Lanka for 15 days. I took an early morning bus from Kandy bus station to Dam bulla. I then took another public bus from Dam bulla main bus station to Sigiriya. The bus fare is only 40 rupees. The bus conductor was kind enough to alert me when the bus arrived at the town nearest to the Sigiriya Lion Rock. From this town, it was about 15 mins walk away from the entrance of the attraction. "
"Comparatively it’s an expensive excursion ($30/pp) but it was really cool to see and learn more about the history. The hike up is quite tough, and we did it in the middle of the day (which I do not recommend!). Best to go for early morning or later on for sunset (unsure of how late you can go up). The views from the top are amazing, and the ruins are interesting to walk around."
"An impressive rock on which there used to be the king’s palace built in the 5th century. Now there are only foundations of these buildings left. Metal walkways are steep and narrow, which might be a challenge for somebody. It’s definitely worth to climb on the top of the rock, as the view is amazing, although in a hot day it’s not an easy walk."
All About Sri Lanka travel crew has hosted more than 1000+ happy travelers in the past 15+ years and Sigiriya is one of the best attractions for every traveler. This is a true marvel of ancient Sri Lanka and it resembles the rich culture and history that goes back to thousands of years.
"This is the highlight of our Sigiriya visit. Our chauffeur guide started us early at 630 am. When we arrived at the ticket office there was already a short queue. Each foreign adult ticket cost LKR5,310/- or USD30/-. We skipped the museum and headed straight for the walk up the rock. Our chauffeur guide could not walk up with us as only licensed guide for the Sigiriya is allowed to conduct guided tour there, but he showed us the way. It was quite easy to follow the path as many people were walking the same way. You can engage a licensed guide inside the Sigiriya, we were approached by one but didn’t ask much about how much it costs etc. The climb was quite steep at some points but the steps and railings helped a lot. It was good that we started early so the weather was not too hot and the pace was faster as there was no human jam. The views along the walk up, down and on top of the rock were spectacular. There were 3 rounds of ticket checking - first at the entrance towards the walk up, second at the mid way and third just before walking up the spiral staircase to view the paintings on the wall. We enjoyed Sigiriya very much! We were back on ground at visitors’ car park at about 8 am, just the right time for breakfast!"
"Go early to avoid the heat, and make sure to bring lots of water.  The view from the top is amazing!  The climb took about 45 minutes each way."
You must go early to this place and get your guide to have entry tickets before you get there (ticket office opens 06.45) 
Sigiriya rock is by far the best thing I've seen in Sri Lanka. It has been declared as the 8th wonder of the world by UNESCO and has a rich history associated with it. 
"A mix of Ramayana and Buddhism. That would best describe this place. This is one of the places, where Lord Buddha actually visited. This is a world heritage site. The climb is a must to the top and the view is breathtaking. almost every stone has a story and ensure that you have a good guide to appreciate the relevance to Ramayana. The place has some interesting sign boards (see photo attached). Don't let it deter you. It is worth the climb"
"There are many steps to climb just to get to the Lions Paw the a steep stairs to the top. A good level of fitness is required to get to the top. A Hat sunscreen and plenty of water is essential. The site at the top is surprisingly large. Care needs to be taken because of uneven ground and steps. A very interesting site for those able to get there. Views are wonderful. Watch out for unauthorised guides, There are no facilities once in the site so be prepared."
"It’s a must to do whilst in Sri Lanka. We stayed a stone throw away, so saw it each day at breakfast. It was a challenging hike to the top but worth the effort, even though it was hot at the top... it’s advisable to take a hat and wear sun screen. We had an amazing tour guide, so he informed us of the history and information throughout, which was helpful. "
"Go VERY early, it opens at 6 30 and you want to be one of he first up Less people and a more comfortable climb. A reasonable level of fitness and a good head for heights essential in parts."
"A steep climb up narrow steps following a steady line of visitors of all ages and ability - so thankful for the metal hand railing. At the top, a cool breeze, the ruins of a 5th-century palace and city, and a panoramic view of the plateau below. Largely the ruins are just foundations, there are a few standing walls. There are no services once you are inside the site so make sure you bring some drinking water; there isnt' any shade and the sun was hot (February). If you are bothered by heights you might find the ascent challenging. Monkeys lounge on the walls, scanning for signs of food, if you bring any food be careful; we saw a lady who was bitten trying to hold onto her snack from a thieving monkey."
"For me, in my opinion, I don’t think it was that great. There’s nothing up there and the way to go was a single track which you have to stucked with a lot of people. I prefer Pidurangala Rock but if you visit Sigiriya, go both rocks!"
"This is a fortress and ancient city which if you are there in Sigiriya, do visit. Be prepared for a little hike, with lots of stairs to climb, spiralling stairs, steep stairs, tiny stairs etc. But it's worth the walk and a little activity. Don't miss out the heritage site..."
We visited Sigiriya early morning - I think this was a wise choice by our guide due to the heat - Sigiriya is stunning and worth a visit but if you don’t like heights / small staircases on the side of a massive rock then this is not for you. The view from the top is amazing but getting there is hard work - we visited with children aged 6 and 10 and they loved the views but they had plenty of of questions of how / why / when etc and lucky for us the guide had the answers. 
"Sigiriya Lion's Rock is one of the best and famous attraction in Sri Lanka. If you are young and fit you should do this activity. It was so fun to Climb, There was so much to learn about history and technology used here. It was rainy day but it was not a big issue for us. It was fun, we enjoyed the rain. It's worth climb to see beautiful view from top of the Sigiriya. AMAZING! "
"I truly enjoyed climbing Sigiriya Rock. Got there early, and we were on our way at about 6:40 am. It’s hot here in April, so there was some serious sweating involved, but it’s not a huge hike really. Bring some water. Also we had our guide / driver with us who always has all the important stories to explain a place - really a great value add, considering there is just some rubble. I thought the entrance fee for a family of four, in excess of USD 100, quite steep, but I am glad we did it. "
"The earlier the better to beat the heat and the crowd. The entrance fee is 5310 rupee for foreigners, which is kind of pricy. It also includes Sigiriya museum that is in the same building of the ticket counter. "
"A big respect to my wife, she had fractured her ankle not long before we travelled but she made it to the top. What a climb !!!! If you are contemplating going make sure you go early in the morning otherwise the crowds are enormous, and take a bottle of water. Boots are not needed but trainers will suffice. Take your camera, excellent views from the top. Well worth a visit."
My daughter and I visited the rock at 630 in the morning. The weather is perfect for walking the rock at this time. 
"It's not just a climb up the rock but has an interesting history behind it. The climb it self was exhausting but with the short stops it helped us gain some breath. Once you reach the top, you totally forget the climb the views are just incredible. Would recommend this to everyone with a healthy heart."
My advice... do it in the morning before it gets too hot. There are steps to be climbed and it could be a challenge. Having said that it is really worth it just to be impressed with the human ingenuity that constructed such a temple. The view from the top is impressive. The frescoes that remain on the rock walls are stunning (note no photography allowed). The area is overall impressively maintained right down to the removal of the plastic wrapping from your drink bottle at the checkpoint. Your bags are also checked for any other plastic materials that could contaminate the site. A model other countries could follow. The stair case is quite safe though I can see it can become busy. The signs for hornets is advisory and definitely not an issue for us. Get there when the park opens to avoid the crowds. Certainly worth the climb. 
We were very excited to visit .. and more excited about the climb with my 6 year old. but trust me the journey was nice but the destination was not even worth the walk..
The ancient city was one of our favorite stops on our trip. The climb to the top of the rock is long but worth it. The view is incredible once you reach the top.
"What an experience it is to climb the rock. Our driver advised us to do it later in the afternoon to avoid the hottest part of the day but nevertheless, it was still nearly 30° when we climbed around 4pm. That said, it was worth it! It wasn’t as busy as some have said in previous reviews, although there were many people, we didn’t have to wait in long queues going up or down. Just the occasional pause to catch your breath and off you go again while others around you do the same. "
This area is fascinating. The museum gives a great insight into the achievements needed to creat a town on top of this rock thousands of years ago.
"Having spent 2 weeks travelling around Sri Lanka, Ella and Sigiriya had their own charms. Sigirya has alot more wildlife to offer. Many will also argue that 5000 rupees to climb the Lion's Rock is too expensive; which it is. However, if you are coming to Sigiriya then climbing the 2 large rocks is something that just has to be done! There are many steps but it is more straightforward than Pidurangala rock - just be aware that their are monkeys nearer to the top who will want to get into your backpacks!"
"We climbed the rock and where not let down, it’s best to have a guide so they can show you things and explain the history. We left our hotel at 6.10am to get to the rock as early as possible ! This was for two reasons to miss the majority of the other tourists and also to do it at the coolest time , I can highly recommend this as it a tough ascent and it gets hot an sweaty. The pain was well worth the it the view was stunning "
"I highly recommend bringing the exact amount of money you need to enter. The price is $35/person, and I dont recommend paying in their local currency as it fluctuates too much from day to day. "
"It was wonderful 
So I’m here at sri lanka together with my local boyfriend and he bring me to sigiriya and it’s was so worth it. It was so amazing as you can see all the ancients scribble and  rock formation. 

Nature is life"
We climbed it yesterday: went OK.
"We left our Sigiriya hotel early to take advantage of the cooler conditions, we drove half an hour to Sigiriya Rock Fortress, a UNESCO site that dates back to the 5th Century when established as a king's palace and fortress. It was later used as a Buddhist Monastery until the 14th Century. "
"We didn't quite make it for 6.30 as we'd hoped, but we had our tickets and were on our way before 7, and it only got crowded when we were on our way down."
"Climbing the rock of Sigiriya is an essential part of a visit to Sri Lanka and possibly the most memorable. It can be crowded and hot but experiencing the climb together with the thousands of Sri Lankan people is not to be missed. Get there early and take plenty of water. A back pack is a good idea to leave hands free as some of the climb is quite steep and exposed, although always robust and safe. There are a lot of steps but it is always crowded so the rate of climb is leisurely and does not feel strenuous for the older person. The climb itself is exciting and breathtaking, but there is also the most stunning cave art after a short stretch up a spiral staircase, and then the view from the top is marvellous."
"This site is huge: much of it is easily accessible at low level - ancient water gardens, fortifications etc. However the focus of the site is the Lion Rock and its fortress. Climbing this will be a challenge for many people. But if you think you are up to it, give it a go. It is mostly stepped, so easy-enough for the able-bodied. The views (even on a misty day) are fabulous. On the summit was a huge fortress evidence of which still remains. "
This is a tremendous site. It is the foundations of an ancient town existing BC. The main attraction is a vertical climb up a rock face to see the foundations of an ancient palace on the top. The climb is just over 1000 steps so you need to be fit and not suffer from vertigo. There are fabulous views and a stopping place two-thirds of the way up if you cannot make it to the top. It is wise to arrive early before 9.00am as it becomes very busy when coach trips arrive.
"This place is full of miracles and I Cant believe I climbed the 1200 plus steps! Such an amazing feeling when you reach the top! its hard to think how it was built at that time. It is a vast area with loads of architectural structures including ponds, Steps, Doors and many more."
The Ancient City of Sigiriya was amazing to see! But... we should have arrived earlier. When we got to the beginning of the path up it was crazy!! There were so many people pushing to get up the stairs. Mant travelers turned around and left to get out the madness. Get there early for less crazy!
I had a voucher so got the first ticket but then with my driver went to the museum which did not open till 8am so when on teh climb. Some tips take water and rest on your way if you can. Im not fit so had to rest on the way and at the top. Wonderful site and later in day returned to see the museum.
Incredible and absolutely worth the cost- as foreigners we should definitely pay more so I do not disagree with this.
The best advice I can give is to get up early and be at the ticket office when it opens at 6.30am
"We are not great explorers! However you cannot go to Sigiriya without giving the rock climb a go. As we discovered, luckily, you don't have to go all the way up but at least get yourself up to the rock paintings and lions feet. Yes it's all quite steep, getting down is harder) but take your time and go early (6:30am) to beat the crowds and heat - we were back at our accommodation nearby by about 8:30. At least you can say you did it!!"
"Finally - a UNESCO site worth the price of admission in Sri Lanka! Somehwat challenging walk - do it in the morning as the rock provides shade for most of the climb. Walk through the well-marked remains of royal gardens on way to the steps and stairs to the top. Once on top, in the midst of a medieval fortress, enjoy 360 degree views. It's a lot easier coming down. Get a pick in front of the Lion's Feet too. Nice breeze on top. Clean (relatively) bathrooms on site."
"The only point is given to the beautiful view of the lion rock, but the management of the site is absolutely TERRIBLE !!! "
My personal opinion is that Lion's rock is both easier and safer compared to Pidurangala. The view on top is amazing but it is primarily the vestiges of an ancient time that are strikingly magnificent.
"I climbed this rock with my two children ages 8 and 4. I was really concerned about the safety. Oh well, the climb is not unsafe at all. All the 1200 steps are well made. Few are bricked and others are metal stairs. They’re fenced as you go up. There are many places in between with shade where you can stop and rest. Its hot no doubt. Carry water and wear sunscreen and hats. Its gets windy as you go up so no worries. "
"Very impressive, but go as early as possible as it is very exposed and hot. We got there at 6.30 when it opens and there were a reasonable number of people there even then. When we were on the top at 8am it was very hot and obviously would be much warmer later in the day. There is little shade on the top."
My wife climbed the rock and as she is a keen rambler said the climb was not difficult at all. Lots of history of the area and well maintained gardens
"One of the highlights of our tour of Sri Lanka. The rock is a 260 metre climb, most of which is via steps on the shaded west side of the rock. "
Climbing sigiriya was one of the best thing I have ever done.It was a challenge.I did walk around the top very much and the view are breathtaking and well worth wobbly knees.It was a great sightseen in srilanka.
"Highlights: First, the walk to the top includes a wall of gorgeous frescoes as well as the incredible lion paw steps. These two stops along the hike make for welcome rest stops, and are really quite amazing! Second, the view from the top is breathtaking, and well worth the climb. Third, the monkeys were really friendly and quite adorable. They kept my spirits high as I began to run out of energy towards the top!"
1000+ steps to climb. It is best to visit early to avoid heat and crowds. View from top is fantastic.
"First of all be careful of large wasp who reside on the top of rock.!!! They attacked the people just after we left the place. few people were hospitalised, I heard. Old king has built the place. It's really worth to climb up and see the ancient paintings and the city ruins. but authorities should pay attention for preserve the paintings, and also the city ruins. Place was overall OK except the site guides on the bottom of rock and the entrance charge for tourist. site guides sometimes really annoying for tourists. someone should do something"
You want to start early as it gets hot and it gets busy. The rock does not look challenging from the base but it is hard work. Take it steady and all will be well.
"If you visited another ancient city in asian country I don’t suggest this place but if you are not it is to be missed. So hot so crowded long way to go up but when you arrive the best part is lion cave. Anything else except some ruined walls and rooms that has not clear information about the time . Elephant rock ,cobra rock shoud not to be missed."
"You need to climb 1200 steps (about 2 hours) to get to the top

No service or shaded areas

Not much to see on top"
"Get up early and get to the rock early before 9am to avoid the heat & crowds. The steep steps and climb to the top are well worth the views and experience .
Take your time going up and look back at the panoramic views!"
"although it can get pretty crowded and it is not a cheap place to visit, still I think that it is worth going there, a lot of climbing to the top compensates the breathtaking view and the remains let you think how it must have looked like in the past in its glory days"
This is an amazing sight to visit. Seen for miles around.If you manage the fairly strenuous walk/climb to the top you will not be disappointed. Its a must if your in this area but make sure you time it right. I climbed at 4.30pm just as it was getting cooler and in time to witness fantastic sunset.
"Is a fortress, high enought to see the neibourhoods. Is a unique senzation that you are on the top of the word, esspecialy because they don't have tall buildings."
With over 1000 steps to climb - of differing types and sizes - this is not for the faint hearted or unfit. You need sturdy shoes and plenty of water. It is best to go very early in the day to avoid crowds and heat. It opens at 7am. It is an amazing site with a lot of history and stunning views from the top.
"My favourite thing I’ve done in Sri Lanka overall. Absolutely amazing!! It’s a long climb so bring water and comfy shoes, you can wear shorts and t-shirt as there’s no temples. I went for sunrise/ it opens at 6:30.its very quiet and you can climb the stairs at your own pace as it’s quite daunting! Enjoy and take lots of photos! "
This is certainly an impressive setting. So impressive that it sure brings in the crowds. Being declared a heritage site by UNESCO guarantees you will be slugged a $US30 admission fee. You are warned by a small notice at the ticket counter that if there is too much crowd congestion on site you may not be admitted. In that case you will not be refunded the ticket price! Similarly if access to the site is terminated by a swarm of wasps from one of the many nests in the area you will also receive no refund. Climbing the rock in the high heat is a bit of a chore but it is likely your climb will be slowed by queues of tourists especially at many of the pinchpoints on the stairway. It would be hard to pass up the opportunity to visit this site but there are a few annoyances associated with it.
Wonderful place to go to have a peace of mind..love it..dont miss that peace of havean if you like to free your self from any kind of civil life and
"Located about 2 hours from Trincomalee, Sri Lanka is the ancient village of Siririya. Overlooking the village is the unique landscape Sigiriya Rock had a palace on top built in the 5th century AD. The Rock is a 200 meter out cropping entered by walking through pathways and magnificent gardens, pools, terraces, and the remnants of buildings. Mid-way up the Rock you arrive at a sectioned off part, just after the Mirror Wall, that includes 19 female fresco figures which date from the 5th century. The government has banned any photography of the figures in order to preserve their coloration. Access to the Mirror Wall, paintings, Lion's Paw and to the top of the rock is a challenge. Many of the rock stairs are uneven and do not include handrails. You need to be physically fit to make the climb to the top but if you are physically challenged you can take a break part way up where there are about three flat break areas and shade. Expect to take about 90 minutes of climbing to arrive at the top of the Rock from the base. The route up to the top is a combination of rock steps, metal stairs, and a few flat areas."
"This site is very touristy but it is worthwhile to visit. It's quite a tough climb but once you get above it the view is phenomenal, the citadel itself is also very beautiful. Great to see what people could already build 1500 years ago. A must do I would say!"
"A good climb up stairs etc.  One needs a head for heights, but 'the going' is good with stairs etc.  Get there early to get fewer crowds and before the heat of the day"
"Wonder how people went to this place at the top of the hill that centuries ago?? Build a beautiful city and sculptures?? How is it all possible when there is no way to reach the top without the support of modern equipment... All remains still a question after seeing this place. A real beauty and at the top of the hill, one could feel what the real strength of a breeze is. Indeed fabulous experience and a forever memorable."
We are very lucky to book the trip with Mr Jerome. He organised our trip and book hotels as well. He is very good. Looking forward book again in future. Thanks Jerome.👌👍
"This place is incredible. A good reminder of ancient engineering...even if we don't understand it. The walk up the rock is challenging but doable - take your time, you'll make it. There is a first aid station half way up :-)"
I arrived the ticket counter before 7am. I suggest you go early in the morning to avoid lots of visitors and the heat.
"We arrived early to avoid the crowds and heat. We also had a guide who was extremely informative and gave us a much more detailed insight into this place than if we had just relied on a guide book, he pointed out many things that we would have missed. Take bottled water but remove the plastic sleeve on the bottle before you arrive as it will save time queuing to have it checked. The climb is ok and there are plenty of places to take a rest and admire the view. By the time we came down at around 9 am it was getting very busy with queues on the staircases. It is a fascinating and beautiful place to visit."
Its a struggle to get to the summit (a proper climb on narrow staircases) but it is well worth it. Incredible views and sense of achievement.
I don't normally climb a mountain early in the morning but this was no ordinary mountain. Sigiria is the largest rock I have ever seen. Goodness knows how many steps we climbed but it was well worth the climb for the stunning views. Fancy ordering a Palace to be built in such a special place. Of course we had the usual Sri Lankan monkeys at every turn. The painted maidens were extremely voluptuous and could be seen at close hand in the museum after you have walked through the gardens. A wonderful experience and well worth the early start and the steep climb.
We hired a personal driver to take us to the Sigiriya Rock from Colombo. This was around a four hour drive and we also visited the Pidurangala Rock and Dambulla Temple on this day.
We visited Lion Rock in early March. 
A very interesting ancient rocky location to visit with beautiful gardens. Difficult climb (1202 stairs) that may take an hour. Better not to take kids and to keep rehydrated. 
We climbed this about 3-30 pm in the afternoon to avoid the morning crowds. This was a good decision taken by our driver Lasi on our Best of Sri Lanka tour.
"It's a walk up a rock with nice views but $60 US for 2 adults is ridiculous.

This is what you call ripping off the tourists 👎

It's a massive thumbs down from me"
"Very nice and interesting place to visit. Made mistake by taking a local guide. He told nicely the history of the place, nut the pace was very fast about 2hrs whole visit, next time more slow place, might take 4-5hrs when no hurry. Guide was also quite expensive. "
"It is nice to see the ruins and experience the history of Sri Lanka. 
Some of the ruins are just foundations others are better preserved. Good to see if you want to experience the history."
This place is pricy and it is quite a climb but well worth it for the view. All info we found said it opens at 7am but the guy in our hotel told us 6.30. We were so pleased we took his advice as by the time we came back down 8.30(ish) the place was heaving with tourists and it was baking hot. Really would advise getting to the ticket office for opening at 6.30 am as it makes for a much more pleasant experience. 
very nice but stupidly no cable car. so the claiming can be difficult for some  especially in the worm and the humidity
This is a must for all tourists and certainly worth the climb. However I would recommend getting there early! Firstly the are less people there so you can actually see the caves properly! Secondly the sun isn’t on you until you get to the top! Stunning views of the surrounding area. Well organised! 
"Amazing sights from the top, fascinating history below. Totaly worth it if you get there early, but get ahead of schoolclasses and touristgroupes. We bought our ticket at 7.30, and were glad we were not later."
Although it was hot and crowded it's worth the effort if you don't mind heights. Some of the steps make you feel exposed even though it's perfectly safe. There are dogs and wild monkeys but they weren't a problem. The young Sri Lankan men who walk along side you offering to assist you every step of the way are a nuisance. Be firm with them and shrug them off otherwise they wont leave you alone and expect money. Spectacular views are your reward plus a sense of achievement.
"One of the must see if touring Sri Lanka - really interesting site, I do not advice if you're traveling with small kids.Watch out for the bee signs. Take lots of water it was around 34 degrees when we made the clim. We had a guide as part of our package which was good to get more information about the history of this site."
"This was the highlight of our stay in Sigiriya, although it was a very hot afternoon we set out from a local hotel, bought the very expensive tickets and then started the climb. There is a long walk even before the climb starts but it's well played out and interesting. The climb can be done at your own pace, there were adequate places to rest. When we reached the top about 90 minutes later the surrounding 360 degree view were well worth the exhaustive nature."
"The view of the rock fortress is incredible to see even from ground level. The climb to the top is steep, mostly stepped and can be a little daunting if you are not keen on heights. It does get very crowded and very hot, so ideally you should get here early. There are lots of monkeys as well and of course dogs. The ruins and view from the top is incredible and well worth the climb. We had a local guide which helped as he explained lots of interesting points about how the palace was built."
"This attraction is ust to make easy money : go to the pidurangala rock, just opposite to this one : it's much much cheaper (if my memory is good, you will pay 5.500 rps for the Lion's Rock and only 500 Rps for he Pidurangala Rock) and you have an even more beautiful view !"
"Like most touristspots, this one is also too expensive Rs5430. We were unlucky that it was weekend. It was crowded even when we tried to be early as possible at the Lion’s Rock. It took us an hour to climb it. Because it was crowded you went little by little and you were never out of breath for the climb. Almost at the top there was some murals. Very nice paintings."
"Quite a challenging climb to reach the summit, but well worth it to see the Kings Palace ruins. En route you take in the frescoes and the Mirror Wall. We were here as part of a group tour with limited time, but you could easily spend most of a day here, depending on your individual interests. Watch out for the naughty monkeys! "
"Unfortunately overcrowded, and takes HOURS to reach the top in the heat. Cave drawings disappointing, better reproduction at the museum where you can also take photos."
"Go early to avoid the crowds. Take your time going up and its not as difficult as it looks from the bottom, and there are lots of resting places and lots to see on the way. Its easy going down."
"C,imb to the top for amazing views. Also learn about the market, gardens and kingdom built there mkre than a thousand years ago...and see tge ruins, plus see nature and wildlife all around you."
"The entrance fee for foreigners is 30 usd... I thought this was excessive given locals only pay 50 rupees, however it does include the museum. It is the same fee to just do the museum, whether you climb the rock or not. It is by far the most expensive attraction in Sri Lanka. The climb will challenge many, as it is 100m up to the frescoes, of which only 19 remain in various states of repair, higher still to the summit. You cannot photograph the frescoes, this was banned in 2015. You risk having your camera confiscated and possible fines if you try it. It is very crowded. Yes, there are some good views from the top, if there is no mist, but you will have many more photo opportunities as you travel around this beautiful country. I much preferred the Dambulla cave temples, these are also a UNESCO site and there is a lot more to see."
We stayed here for 3 days and got about a bit doing the tourist type things but other than that there doesn’t seem to be a lot to do.
"This UNESCO World Heritage site was the location of King Kassapa I's palace from 477 to 95 AD. Tickets for foreigners (non-Sri Lankans) cost about 30 USD but are well worth the price. After a comfortable walk through gardens and stone walkways at the base of the rocky mountain, there is a serious climb to the top with at least one detour along the way with Buddhist wall paintings. The final part of the climb after the lion's foot is on steep metal stairways. This is steep although with hand guards and a fence to prevent falls. The whole climb is a good workout so this is not recommended for those who are in poor physical condition. The top has ruins of the original palace (it is mind boggling to think how this was constructed in the 5th century) and amazing views of the valley and surrounding lakes. Highly recommended!"
"My wife and I visited here several times during our recent birdwatching tour of Sri Lanka. The Rock itself is very impressive best viewed from some distance to view its vastness. We didn’t walk up the rock and this was beyond our abilities, we did however speak to people who did and they were very impressed. We walked the gardens, mainly looking at the bird life, which was extensive. But all the area around the rock is excellent for wildlife watching, particularly the birds, butterflies and wildflowers. "
World heritage place and definitely worth of visit. Experience was great. Also beautiful view from the top.
"Went with Sundaras resort to Sigiriya mountain, very friendly and helpful staff. Everything went perfect. For 15$ you get a tour driver and foods and drinks. I recommend go Sigiriya in the morning.. stunning view and climing Sigiriya itself was the most amazing trip."
"Take the guided tour, climb all the 1202 steps of various ladders. Use the imagination to feel how it was to be a king of the mountain. It is so great!"
"A fantastic historical site, with a very interesting history. The climb is not for the unfit but the views are worth it. The guides are extremely helpful and caring. Alround a wonderful experience well worth the effort involved"
"This was a great adventure. Walking through the gardens up to the rock as the sun was rising. Lots of steps, yes, but hey what is at the top is just unbelievable. How did they get it all up there all those years ago? Fantastic views from the top. Just do it! "
"Highly recommended to do, but preferably with a guide who can provide the historical facts about the place. Early morning is best - before the heat and the crowds - otherwise you can be queuing for a long time (hours!). The views from the climb as well as the various levels and summit are fabulous. Also recommended is Pidurangala Rock so you can see back to Lion's Rock."
Early morning climb. Worth it when you get the views. Go as early as possible.  It gets very busy & can be a little clostrophobic on stairways
"Like a lot of key historical sites in Sri Lanka, Lions Rock is crazily priced for foreigners at $30 when put in context to the cost of other things. "
This stunning place simply is amazing and is a must on any tour.
"There are many reviews already about this Rock, but there is one more thing, everybody seems to ignore. Climbing this rock costs 30USD per person, wich is 5400SLR! Locals only pay 50SLR! To enter the Louvre costs only 20USD. I don't understand why nobody is willing to recognize this Ludacris price for a monolith with a ruin on top. I cannot advice this trip. Even my local driver told me that it's a SCAM."
A remarkable achievement building a palace on top the rock. Only the ruins now exist but a must see of the area.
...I got some amazing shots from around the area.
I’d read a lot of reviews about the amount of people and how long it takes but it was no problem. We went at 9am on a Sunday and although there were plenty of people that actually made it better because the pace was nice and steady. Plenty of rest stops. I have a trapped nerve in my leg and found it fairly hard going but pushed on and was glad I did. Views were amazing how they did it is incredible! 
This is a really worthwhile experience & the view at the top & the ruins of the ancient palace are a great reward for your efforts. The climb sounds very difficult but it is very achievable as there are several natural breaks on the way up. Do the small diversion on the way up & climb the spiral staircase to see the frescos of the Sigiriya damsels.
"A daunting climb (we are very late sixties) when you first view it but there are stages so you can take a breather. Over 1500 steps to the top but totally worth the effort. The murals, half way up and a steep spiral staircase to reach them are good but not fantastic so you could miss this bit out if the climb is already taxing. Take a rest at the lion's feet before the final metal staricase to the top. The ruins of the palace are stunning and incredible to think how they built this in the first place so many years ago. A busy tourist sight but well worth it."
"I'm not going to explain. Just trust, you need to do this. And wear good shoes, come hydrated, and enjoy it! it's very cool"
If you want some exercise and good views try this ! We looked at it and thought no way are going up 1200 steps but our guide who was very good kept pushing us on and we eventually made it to the top. It's one of those things you jut have to do if you are there!
"This is a large area to explore with many, many steps. Really best to visit early as crowds grow mid-morning. New ticket office and museum. A wonderful site."
"While staying in Kandy we decided to go to Sigiriya, and we are glad we did! The tuk tuk ride there was almost 3 hours, but with some stops underway (we would recommend to take the stops on the way back though, as to get there as early as possible), it was okay."
This is the place to visit when visiting Sri Lanka. The name refers to a site of historical and archaeological significance. It is 200 metres (600 feet) high.
"Ancient civilization , it is amazing to see what people can do from thousands years ago. "
You can’t come to Sigiriya and not do this!
"We visited and paid the very hefty 30 $ each - however we didn’t want to climb as we had heard it is very busy and can be dangerous of overcrowding at points, plus I don’t like heights too much. We walked up and around the rock which is nice, but even arriving at 8.45am it was so incredibly hot, almost unbearable. After a walk around we went out the gate, and there are tuk tuk drivers that will drive you around the outside of the area for 2k rupee and you get to see incredible views of both rocks from the lake and see some local villages etc too. "
"The day I went up was a Sunday and there were extremely long queues on the approach, but these did seem to be confined to the lower parts of the climb before the spiral staircase. At that point I was minded to quit, but beyond that point everything seemed to move much more quickly."
"We are both in our mid 50s unfit and a little over weight, but we did it, it’s hard going and it took us at a steady pace just over an hour to get to the top including a 10 min break 3 quarters of the way up."
"We visited ancient city of Sigiriya and climb on Lion’s rock, to get the wonderful view over the ruins of ancient city of Sigiriya. Absolutely worth visiting. Keep you backpacks closed as otherwise you may get ripped off by monkeys. On some occasions wasps may attack. And they are huge. The entrance fee for adult is 30 $ and for kid (from 6 - 12) 15$."
"I must admit I was a little apprehensive about the climb up the metal stairs on the rock, but all was good (concentrate on the walking, not looking down). A nice fitness test too. We really enjoyed the surrounding (rock) gardens at the base of the mountain. they were beautifully landscaped, lovely and tranquil and after the adrenaline high of the climb, nice to relax in and wander about."
"Go early - we arrived as it opened, before it got really busy and really hot. "
"Made sure I was here by 6.15am and was virtually the first to the top. Unusually it was very misty, approaching the rock from the entrance with the sun behind it made for a great photo opportunity."
"I'm sure with nearly 10,500 reviews of this site it's all been said before, however, I would say that my wife was quite daunted by the climb but found it most worthwhile and would do it again. The steps are safe with handrails and the final part of the climb is via a well constructed walkway with separate steps for those travelling either up or down. A no point are you traversing rocks or open spaces with a danger of falling. Just take your time."
Fantastic World Heritage site. An early start at 07:00 is recommended to avoid the heat and crowds. The climb is worth as the view from the Rock is spectacular. The entrance fee for foreigners is ridiculous as it does not include anything for this cost. A brochure/leaflet summarising the history of the place should at least be included with the ticket so no additional fee is required for a guide. It is extremely crowded between 7:30 and 09:00 and there should be a system to control the numbers going up at a time as the stairs are very narrow and steep at the top.
"It is worth getting the history about the rock from a guide and then go up, it makes it much more interesting than just a view."
"We stayed in paradise sun hotel, visited this place, took surrounding trip, if you can climb, then go on top,"
"This site in our view was expensive to visit, but worth a look, the site itself does not offer to much to see as it’s mostly just foundations. The climb not as hard as we thought. We went early and avoided the crowds going up, but coming down we saw a huge volume of people coming up, so go early and avoid the heat. No issues with the bees but a lot people just ignored the warnings and were noisy anyway. Great views from the top."
We really liked the climb to the top of the rock. Our tour guide was was Hika from Singhagiri village safari. The place has a very interesting history and he did a great job of educating us on that. It definitely made the tour more entertaining. 
Visitef the Great Sigiriya Fort with a guide and was given a thorough explanation to this ancient palace. The entry price of USD30 is pretty expensive but it was still worth the visit.
This is a UNESCO heritage listed sight. How on earth they built a fortress on the gigantic rock is beyond my imagination.
We entered the National Park at 6:30 a.m. when it opened so it wasn‘t too crowded. Tickets are ridiculously pricy (30$ per person). Climbing up takes about 45 minutes and isn‘t too hard. Bring Water! The view is breathtaking! So all in all an experience you shouldn‘t miss!
the mystery of history is at the rock. Do the walk and then go to museum where the animation of what was possibly the structure on the rock blew me away.
"It's expensive, It's a hard climb, it's hot, but it's the most beautiful view we saw the whole trip."
"Even if it will cost you $25USpp to enter the site it is absolutely worth it. A Unesco heritage ''monument', also referred to as Lion rock. The climbing is not hard, regular stops, 1,200 steps, just a few large rocks at the top. Great at sunset ( and not has hot as mid afternoon), busiest 11h00 to 3h30. Takes approx. 45 minutes up due to crowds (20 minutes down) but you will not regret it. After all it is the most known landmark in Sri Lanka! Do check frescoes in caves and the ''mirror'' wall. Use toilet before, none after and bring pack sac with water. Could be windy at top. Watch out for your bags or anything you might leave unattended for a few seconds...the monkeys are very quick!"
"We arrived at 7am and were at the top for 7.30am. Temperature is great at that time and the crowds minimal. Price is extortionate at 5500 rupees for foreigners however the view is spectacular! Would not advise visiting after 9am as crowds got really crazy and by the time 11 o'clock came, the queue was all the way down and at a stand still (no thanks in that heat!). "
Our guide suggested we visit later in the day ....we followed the travellers advice and not our tour guide and got up early and arrived at 7.15am 
"The climb was easy for us since we were in a queue the whole way up and it took about 80 minutes. The slow speed suited us since it was a cloudy, windy day and standing around in the sun was not an issue. Interesting paintings on the way up and the city remains on the summit are amazing, as is the view. Take your time, rather than too many photos, and absorb the atmosphere. Do not take food as the monkeys on the way up are superb security guards and will take it from you!"
This hugh rock has what seems to be vertical faces and near impenetrable.
"The scenery, the nature and the history of this place is astonoshing and worth a visit. However in peak season it's very crowded and we had to stand in a line both on our way up and on our way down, which was a big drawback of the overall experience. Also, I think 30dollars is alot to charge, concidering the experience. Possibly better to go some other time during the year. "
"Fortunately I stayed within 20 minutes of the rock and got to the museum at 6.45 am having been told tickets go on sale at 7am. I bought my ticket (cash only), was already climbing the rock at 7am and was one of the first 20 to get to the top. The experience was amazing due to the peace. The climb back was a completely different matter. The hoards arrived around 8am and there was a queue to the top (heaven knows what the top was like!). If you have the chance go as early as possible and DO NOT go on a national holiday - we heard stories of hour plus queues at 8am on the Bak Full Moon Festival in February and I would imagine the experience would be ruined."
"This is a very long climb, best to go early in the morning before the crowds."
Entrance fee is pretty steep for tourists but the grounds are lovely and there's plenty to see here.
Very crowded even though we got there early - the steps are ok even though there are a lot of them to the top of the rock but the crowds make it quite tricky and if its raining I would give it a miss as the stone gets very slippy and the metals steps quite dangerous if you are ok on your feet give it a go if not dont risk it. Views from the very top are excellent on a clear day. Small tourist souvenir market at the bottom but dont expect coffee shops and cafe they are very limited and water and pop out of a container are about the best we managed
2nd part of our trip in Sri Lanka was Sigiriya. This was great place. Hot and crowded day but still we did love it! We took some guide with us and it was really worth it! He explained us the whole history and also he showed us best routes to the top and back. I recommend this place must visit and also I recommend guide if you are interested something else than a view.
The steps weren’t too bad - everybody could do the steps they just need to take their time. The views are worth it !
"We only had 13 days in Sri Lanka and were undecided whether we should visit Sigiriya due to time restrictions. We were glad we did! Definitely recommend early arrival to beat the crowds though - we started our hike up at 7.30am and once it top the views were awesome. I must say I do think I enjoyed the hike up to the neighbouring Pidurangala more the day before for sunset, as the view from the top includes the actual Sigiriya Lion Rock itself, with less tourists."
The climb was over crowded and at times felt unsafe on some metal with lots and lots of people standing on it hanging off a rock.. but my goodness the view was worth every single sweat bead running down your back. It’s hard work at times but the reward and breezing running through your hair up the top was worth it. Make sure you take water and there is no place to buy it up the top. 
We had an early morning start here to beat the crowds - and the weather. It was a wise move on behalf of our wonderful guide / chauffeur Sesath. I would not have wanted the stress of queues and press of people which was beginning to build as we left.
"Of course a fantastic world herritage, but leaves you with a feeling of being cheated. Very expensive for foreiners and the hazzle with local guides who take tourists who are willing to pay even more to pass all ques should be prevented by the sitemanagement. Avoid od possible at the time of local school holidays!! Looong ques. "
"It’s worth revisiting, lots of climbing but not too hard. As we seem to be the last group before closing, we enjoyed the panoramic view of beautiful sunset."
Quite a climb but not as scary as we’d been led to believe. Well worth it as the ruins at the top are extensive and the view is fabulous. But you need to get there early. On our way down at 10am the queues were horrendous. We heard one guide leading his tour up a back route and saying that the main queue would take four hours! When we got back to the hotel the heavens opened and we felt so sorry for those people still in the queue with no shelter.
"Found the gardens and water spaces very calming, well laid out and well maintained. Royal cave temple also known as the Golden Temple of Dambulla is a World Heritage Site in Sri Lanka, situated in the central part of the country. This site is situated 148 kilometres east of Colombo and 72 kilometres north of Kandy. Dambulla is the largest and best-preserved cave temple complex in Sri Lanka."
"At the entrance prepare yourself to have the bags searched and the plastic bottles with the label taken off, also prepare yourself to refuse a few times a personal guide. The surrounding are beautifull and the climb, well, slow as it’s overcrowded. Once on the top you have a great view and the beauty of the ruins. It worth the walk for the history and the view. A little bit pricey the entrance. Be aware of the monkeys, as soon the smell food they attack you even if the snack is in your bag"
"A 600 feet tall steep rock jutting out of the earth. Difficult to avoid seeing it, no matter where you go. It is a magnificent view. 1500 years ago a king built his palace and fortress atop the rock! What a feat of engineering!! The huge paws are the evidence of the gorgeous stone lion at the top. The palace and the fortress are gone. Only the foundations remain. As does a large water tank (the king's swimming pool - the guide said) and the huge stone throne from where the king held court. "
I got to the ticket office at 6.30am when it opened - it was a Saturday and there was still a group of us waiting even at that time. It does feel expensive compared to other tourist sites in Asia but if you've flown all this way...!
"Absolutely stunning and a great morning hike. Assuming average fitness, if you’ve done hikes before, and if there isn’t a throng of tourists ahead of you, then it should take about 45 minutes to reach the top."
"This place is amazing from the ruins on the low parts to the palace on the mountain. Do this activity as early in the morning as possible for it gets very hot.
A must do."
"Wow !!. In the end it was totally worth it. Do this as early in the morning as you can because it is very hot and many many steps, some very steep. Once on top the views are amazing. Don't mind the long lines because it moves slower and allows you to rest and pace yourself. A must do. Admission is approx 30 USD."
"Takes almost 2 hours to go and come back.Its must visit place,has a beautiful view from the top of this mountain."
"I was a trifle nervous about all those steps, but I shouldn't have worried as you can choose your own pace and break off now and again if you feel like it. Once there, it would be a shame not to do the full bit, and I was glad to have made the effort. The view for the top is rewarding indeed."
"1200 steps to the top in an unbroken stream of traffic. Plenty of places to drop out and rest though. If you don’t rush, take it easy and take water (none available when you start the climb) it isn’t too difficult. The rust on the metal stair sections was a little disconcerting!!!!! I took a guide (2000 rupees +500 tip) and this was worth it, I learnt a lot. Unbelievably some people were taking very young children to the top - that is just stupid, it’s too hot and the steps are to high in places. Perhaps the ticket office should set a minimum age and height to counter unthinking parents. "
Go early and take your time to enjoy this awesome citadel. Unbelievable construction in just 7 years with great care taken to use natural beauty
"Having spent several days travelling, we overslept and ended up climbing Sigiriya at midday - definitely a time to avoid! We made it to the top and ensured that we kept well hydrated, there are plenty of spaces where you can take a few minutes rest if needed. The view from the top is incredible and gives you a real sense of achievement. We visited the museum first and this gave us a great insight into the history of the site, the only thing was that we were followed round by a security guard for most of this which made me feel as if we were somewhere that we were not meant to be. "
"It was so busy And crowded, we had a very slow ascent, which was just as well given the heat and height. But when you get to the top it’s fine with amazing views."
It is quite a climb to the top so if you don’t want to climb in the heat of the day get there early. If you really don’t like heights think about this carefully. It’s fine going up but coming down you have no choice but to look down for feet placement. The views from the top are wonderful and you will see plenty of monkeys! Well worth a visit.
We visited the Lion Rock early one morning to beat the crowds. The site is very impressive and is an amazing place to visit. The climb to the top takes a few steps but its well worth it. You will no doubt be amazed as to how they managed to build everything on the top! The only down side for us was that it satrted raining half way up so the views from the top were zero
We had been warned to go early but didn’t want to go at the recommended time or the teens would moan. So we arrived at about 9.30am and the site was quite busy. It was hot but the humidity was the real challenge. There were sections where we had to queue but to be honest I didn’t mind as it meant we climbed at an even tempo (rather than me trying to keep up with the kids) which made it much more so-able. Bring as much cold water as you can carry as you won’t be able to buy any until you get back down. A cold flannel (or just one to wipe up the sweat) would have been helpful as would a hand held fan. The frescos are worth the nail biting climb up the spiral staircase if you can and the views at the top is amazing. The steps are all sorts of depths and materials and rarely have any type of handrail. I’m not fit but I’m able bodied and I think that is a pre-requisite. Anyone with a bad knee or ankle might struggle to get up but almost certainly to get back down. 
Take time to explore the gardens before attempting the climb. The climb up the stairs is hard work but the views from the top are magnificent. Because you are so busy watching your step going up it is easy to forget to look up and appreciate the scenery. The stairs arecquitw narrow at times but slow and steady will get you there. Wear walking shoes and take water to drink on the way.
We went 7:30 and even then there were many people going up however we enjoyed the climb but when coming down around 10 que was all the way to the bottom and it would have taken 2-3 hours just to climb up. Get up early and enjoy the rock.
"This is a truly dont miss part of Sri Lanka. The climb starts with stone steps but then there are some bottom clenching metal staircases and steps precariously attached to the side of this rock. It is steep, it is a long way down I wouldnt suggest you try this if you have vertigo . "
"Great sight of major importance however we got lumbered with a ‘guide’ who we hadn’t asked for but then expected a massive tip, so beware! Our driver who caught up with us negotiated a cheap ‘ go away deal’"
In my opinion.
"I have a fear of heights and so was a little concerned. Our guide said that I could get a hand up if I needed. Well I did it on my own. It is a very slow pace due to all the people. Hundreds of people. But they have it well layer out and things move very smoothly. Lots of places to hold onto. So worth it when you get to the top. The views are amazing. For me getting to the top was my highlight. There were very old as well as very young children. Beware not to take any food as you encounter many monkeys. Wear a hat and take water, you will be totally drenched from sweat. "
"Absolutely stunning view on the top. It is a hard climb so be prepared for that. 

A good advice is to be there early before the man rush starts. We were there at 8.00 am in the morning which was very good."
We were nervous about climbing Sigiriya Rock. Neither of us are a fan of heights and the sound of 1200 steps didn’t exactly appeal.
"This places is cultural site but bad maintain. Everything is seem rusty and low, less, and afar from being safe. Stair up to and most area have no fence, enjoy it's top with your own risk."
"Been to 7 wonders, and still questioning about how Sri Lankan manage their heritage site in such WEIRD way. Away from park lots - inside museum building is ticket counter which you have to line for very long waiting just to pay 30$ for single visit. "
We made the trip to the summit of Lion Rock under the wise recommendation of our guide to start as soon as the attraction opened and before the heat of the sun was up.
We tried to go visit. The enterance fee is £45 per person. It has 375 steps and is very steep to get to the top. Although if you can not go up and only get to the half way you should be able to see the feet of lion. 
A must see! Before you begin the ascent you pass through the gardens - one side has been archaeologically excavated and the other not. Interesting to see what a project the excavation would have been and the layout is beautiful. The climb is lots and lots of steps (no boulder clambering!) but do go early doors before the temperature rises and before the tour bus crowds build making for an extremely slow ascent. The views from the summit are truly amazing
"Well, expect long lines. Expect to meet lots of locals, especially in the weekends. And expect a long steep walk. But arriving at the top, you just feel amazed. The view, if nothing else. But walking in the ruins of the temples and buildings makes you wonder... Waauuhh. So just do it"
We visited on a public holiday and the numbers ascending the rock were ludicrous. We shuffled our way up so slowly that it took over 2 hours to reach the top. I would happily have bailed out after 30 minutes but there was no way back through the crowds as you ascend and descend on different routes.
"Visiting the citadel of Sigiriya has been one of my longstanding dreams since 1982 when for the first time I listened to ""Save a prayer"" by Duran Duran and watched the related video. Now it is not anymore as meanwhile my dream has finally become true. "
"This was our first stop on our Sri Lanka trip and what a way to start. It boggles the mind to think that people built anything on top of this magnificent rock formation, let alone about 2000 years ago for the monastery and then later for the fortress. It costs about 30 US dollars for the entry ticket. It's not an especially tough climb but I was pretty nervous on some of the steeper staircases. Most of the ascent is metal staircases attached to the side of the sheer rock face. There can be queues at the narrower parts and particularly close to the entrance of the caves where you can see cave wall paintings. Don't have any snacks on the way up or you will attract the attention of the monkeys!"
"Everything about this site is breathtaking. The natural wonder of the rock itself, the paintings and the ruins. One of those great experiences you just feel so lucky to have had."
This is a must do if you visit Sri Lanka. Don’t forget to go on a day that it’s not raining. The place will offer you a 360-degrees superb view. The forest looks endless from the top. Remarkable. Make sure you bring some hat and a bottle of water with you during your trip.
Gorgeous view form the top . A bit of a climb but well worth the effort. it is interesting to see the old scaffolding on the way up. Some of the stairs are not for the faint of heart.
This is a World Heritage Site - It's a bit of a climb but the end view is well worth it.
we want to sigiriya during our honeymoon tour that was fantastic. panoramic view. early morning we claimed. after  9am so many tourist. some one going to around habarana vary near sigiriya. nice experience.
"What an amazing place. Having read some reviews we were a bit concerned that we wouldn’t be fit enough to climb the rock but we needn’t have worried. It can be a bit strenuous in the heat but well worth the effort when you reach the top. One review we read said that you have to take your shoes off but you DO NOT, nor do you need to cover up. We advise that you visit as early as possible to avoid the heat and crowds. There are no toilets once you are inside the grounds. Also go to the Museum before you climb, it is really good and informative."
Quite a climb with parts of the ascent on exposed metal staircases which were quite challenging for someone who has a fear of heights. Worth every step though as the views from the top are absolutely stunning. At 30$ its the most expensive site we’ve paid to see in Sri Lanka but it’s also the best. Don’t miss it 
"We arrived 7am, and it got busy very quickly. You can feel like you're on a bit of a tourist production line."
"Leisure travel means differently to everyone, and if you love the adrenaline rush of adventure, climbing the world-famous Sigiriya Lion Rock in Sri Lanka, could be right for you. The Ancient City of Sigiriya is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The entrance fee per person is 4500 LKR which is around $30 USD. The climb up the rock and back down will take from 1.5 hours to 3 hours. I suggest arriving early in the morning and climbing as soon as possible as it gets busier as the day goes on. Sigiriya is definitely worth a visit, it is in itself a very impressive site to behold."
My wife and I (both 27) visited last week. There was a lot of rain on the day and unfortunately this is very weather dependent. We were able to visit the museum (don't expect much!) during the worst of the rain but still got quite wet climbing the rock and views from the top were totally obscured. This is also VERY expensive by Sri Lankan standards - especially as it only takes a couple of hours. 
We climbed lion rock early in the morning.beautiful views from the top and more ruins also.little bit crowded but very beautiful.
"A pretty stunning place, we scooted around the museum first before heading off to the famous rock fortress. It was a little busy - we went late afternoon. There was a slow moving queue to get up to the cave paintings and then it sped up as we got towards the large platform with the lion paws. Some very special views and a truly magical place. It’s amazing to think this was built without the help of machines and technology! "
They have moved the local car park for a different place where local people have to walk more than 800 meters just to reach the entrance gate to Sigiriya rock. Where they provide a closer place to the foreigners and get 5600 SL rupees for parking. Putting very small boards as no camera pictures and try to bribe when they caught taking pictures with the mobile phones in Sigiri girls pictures area... 
"We came in just as the place opened. It definitely got noticeably more crowded shortly thereafter, so I suggest you get there as early as you can. We explored the citadel on the top, and we also enjoyed the grounds and smaller trails and caves around the area. I think they only take cash and we could not get the ATM to work, so make sure you have enough cash to cover the tickets."
"We climbed with a guided tour and went early in the morning. It seemed busy to us on the way up, but coming down the lines were huge. It is a hard climb, but the view is amazing and there is alot to spend time looking at at the top. It does help having a guide as it is far more interesting if you can hear historical facts and information. Take it slowly, enjoy all of it and absorb the history. Most cultures do not not have the opportunity to share this kind of history, so respect all of what is on offer here."
"Well where do I begin? Just do it! Don't be put off by the climb, I won't say it's easy but tiny children do it. We met an elderly lady who was advised not to do it, her friend went up instead and now she regrets listening to the advice! It is a real once in a lifetime experience. Astounding to imagine how it was built! "
"I hai the chance, during my trip in Sri Lanka, to visita the Cidadel of Sigiriya the Lion rock and it was a fantastic and unforgetable experience. First of all’ because you can walk within an area full of vegetation. Yes there Will be a lot of stairs to arrive on the top but the view from there si magnific! Tra to arrive there early morning so you can walk without to much Sun and hot temperature."
"We went in the morning as we heard the crowds came towards the afternoon however as we left it was dead so I'd recommend going in the arvo. It wasn't overly busy however you were taking one step at a time due to the amount of people climbing. It is not a difficult climb, not as bad as I was expecting. It is a bit exspensive 5500R however something to do while in Dambulla and there were some nice views at the top. Try and go on a clear day as the mist from the rain spoils the view a bit."
"The only reason for coming to Sigiriya is to see this rock and the old city on the top, so of course we had to do it. The climb looks worse than it is and providing you start early - by 8:30 the crowds aren't too bad and most of the climbing up is in the shade. There is a big terrace maybe 60% of the way up to stop and rest or maybe not continue beyond it. The part where you walk up a spiral staircase welded to the rock face is a bit disconcerting for some, and it's immediately followed by the cave paintings which we rather missed in the recovery from the spiral staircase! only to find that the next stage was down a different spiral staircase. Great views from the very top, but no explanatory signage whatsoever, which really is poor, there's plenty of space and the amount being charged to foreigners to visit is high, so surely they can do better."
"We did this at 8am in the morning, Which I would recommend before it gets too hot and crowded. Having a guide to show you and tell you all the different areas of reference is crucial. We would not have gotten half the experience we did without ours."
Loved this so much!
"We visited with a guide this was useful to explain to us the history behind this fascinating place. 
Good climb up but visit early to beat the crowds"
"We visited with a guide this was useful to explain to us the history behind this fascinating place.

"Amazing view from the top and the surrounds leading up to the rock are very beautiful. We got there mid morning and it was slow going getting up there so allow a couple of hours because the lines can take some time. Despite the crowds it is well worth seeing, the crowds wouldn’t be there if it wasn’t as amazing sight as it is so have to just accept that it’s popular for a reason. 30 usd fee per person is significantly more than we paid for entry into any other attraction in the area but it is was by far our favourite activity of the day "
"This should be the 8th Wonder of the World.  A truely amazing experience, 1202 steps to the top, which at first seemed a daunting experience but so worth it.  Wonderful views and an incredible history.  Highly recommend a visit to the Lion Rock."
"Entry Fees - for Indians - $15(you need to bring the passport for that otherwise $30), for other than Indians $30"
"Sigiriya Rock is an ancient rock fortress located in Sigiriya, Srilanka"
"This was a long walk, in grounds with a fascinating history. Our guide spoke of the levels of protection here including the moats with crocodiles in."
"An incredible place and a nice viewpoint from the top. If you want to avoid the crowd and guided tour, go there early (around 8 AM) or late (from 3:30 PM). You dont need a guide at all, but it is better to be fit to climb the narrow staircases. Visit the museum before climbing, you will get all the info about the legend of the place."
"I wasn’t looking forward to climbing the rock myself, but I’m so glad we went. The view from the top is an amazing panorama, and my friend wanted to stay up there until sunset. Because there weren’t many clouds, the sunset itself was a bit anticlimactic, but it was nice to chill at the top of the mountain. "
The history of the Rock is extremely interesting and goodness knows how a palace was built up there. Pick up a brochure as it's quite an interesting historical and cultural site with the Water Gardens and technology around water.
It is amazing to see that older generation too had excellent plans to keep the surroundings with lush green gardens and fountains. It is like a gateway to the famous famous Sigiriya Lion Rock.
"Sigiriya is an amazing geological formation in Sri Lanka that encompasses an important archaeological site. Sigiriya lies 22 km north-east of Dambulla in the North central province of Sri Lanka. The tourist site of Sigiriya has been declared as a UNESCO world heritage site since 1982 and is part of the seven world heritage sites of Sri Lanka. Sigiriya is located in the middle of the tourism cultural triangle formed by connecting the world heritage sites of Anuradhapura, Kandy and Polonnaruwa in Sri Lanka. Giant Lion's paw mid way is beautiful. Mirror wall, old paint using locally available herbs, lime stone etc. is wonderful. Stairs and railings are well maintained. In the top there are ruins of king's residence. 'Never to miss item' in Sri Lanka tour. "
"$30usd payable only in cash at the gate is complete extortion for this place given they seem to put no real effort into the surrounding amenities or the rickety stairs perched precariously on the side of the rock. Once you get over being robbed by the entry fee, and make it to the top of the rock the views are spectacular, but as it is ""the"" thing to do in Sigirya it is always crawling with tourists which makes the narrow stairways even harder to navigate. Do it to say you've done it, and tick it off as an accomplishment but don't expect great things from the museum for your entry fee. Nearby Pidurungala rock is much more affordable (500 LKR) and rewards slightly more adventurous climbers with equally if not more so, spectacular views especially if you reach the summit for sunset to view Lion Rock from there."
"We had an excellent guide, Ika, which made our trip. In addition he organized someone to help an elderly lady in our group to climb the many steps. That was exactly the right thing to do. 

Unbelievable views, and very interesting history. Highly recommended"
"We were at the NP as the gates opened, and I am glad! So many people and the heat coming down was brutal! "
"This really is a must do. We climbed early morning when busiest but shadier. Lots of stairs but slow and steady climb due to number of people!! Terrific views from the top and more ruins than I was expecting, like a small scale Sri Lanka ‘Machu Picchu’!! Easy to miss the museum on the way in but it is worth a visit if for nothing else you will have time to study the fresco replicas which you won’t have for the real thing if it is busy. "
"7 am start for cool climbing conditions. At top by 8 and stayed 3 hours marvelling at awesomeness all around. Into village for lunch and back for afternoon in water gardens and around lower features. This is an astonishing place full of ancient history, well tended by SL authorities."
It’s got to be done! The climb to the top is hard work but nothing too bad for someone of reasonable fitness. 
"We went to Lion Rock on second day of our holiday (after Negambo), our driver (Athula) stopped at one of the little shops to purchase our tickets.We arrived late afternoon at 14:30 and decided to watch the sunset at the top. The place looked beautiful with the low-sunlight."
"200m high ancient rock fortress of King Kashyapa which also known as the ""Lion Rock."" This is a must visit unique archeological place in Sri Lanka which sometime refers as the 08th wonder of the world. It's a magnificent proof of the architectural technology of ancient Sri Lankans. "
"Being in our late 60s and not particularly fit, I had some reservations about my ability to climb the rock - but it was fine. The crowds (even at before 8am) slow you down and it was all fairly even steps."
"We are in our late 60s and not particularly fit so a bit worried if we would cope climbing the rock - it was fine, neither as difficult nor as unnerving as I had been led to believe. We were there before most of the crowds (about 8am) but even so, we often found ourselves being held up by those in front so there was no pressure to over exert yourself! Definitely worth going early or late in the day to avoid crowds and heat."
"Probably the most beautiful thing of Sri Lanka. Don't miss it. 
Don't be afraid to climb the rock. It's easy"
It’s a great attraction but beware it is the most visited attraction in Sri Lanka so it is very very busy. The walk is a good 1200 steps long but due to the large number of people it will take you a while regardless of your fitness level so not suitable if you are in a rush. The view is very beautiful but can be tiring so take a snack and your water bottle as even the journey down can be a long wait. 
"Best to visit early in the morning before it gets too hot and busy, although sometimes it is misty in the morning so you cant appreciate the views from the top."
"This is such an amazing place to visit. The steps are well maintained and it’s a good climb for most peoples fitness level. If you have any medical conditions take it slow, there are some steep parts that will get your heart rate up...Red Cross is at the top of the climb should you need an assistance. Once at the top, which takes about an hour the view is spectacular and on a hot day you will enjoy the breeze. "
"a site that is rich in history and culture. had a perfect guide who knew the detailed history if the place and was able to give us an account of what happened before through the timeline. From monastery to a grand palace and being returned to the monks after the regaining the place. the site has loads of cultural paintings. the climb is tiring but enjoyable, however the structure looks slightly precarious and whimsy. Together with some unruly tourists, that can be a potential hazard, overcrowding is an issue. It is an interesting site to visit."
It takes about 45 mins to walk up and the same to come down. We saw lots of moneys along the way which was lovely. 
"We visited Sigiriya as part of a tour. Our guide through TUI was ‘Obama’ who was brilliant, we learnt so much about the history of the Fortress. It’s quite a climb, so if anyone has any mobility problems I wouldn’t recommend it. The excavations of the area shows how complex the buildings were around the base of the rock. The paintings in the caves on the rock are amazing when you think how long they have been there. Well worth the visit but wear suitable footwear for the climb. Take plenty of water with you as you cannot get any once you are on the rock. Also if you take any food stuffs with you keep them safe in a rucksack, as we saw monkeys knock a bag of fruit out of a ladies hand when climbing the Fortress."
"This is a lovely and interesting site and is well maintained, but it gets very busy. We arrived at the site at 7:00 AM, when the ticket office opened. It was wonderful to be ahead of the worst of the crowds. We climbed the fortress with relatively few others but by time we came back down the crowds were huge and the charm we experienced in the morning had been killed. Again, go early!"
I have vertigo ..it was not frightening at all. We are not fit at the moment and did it in an hour ...just took our time and drank plenty of water. We are 69 & 63 respectively...whilst it is not a doddle it is still very doable. We used a guide who was very informative and we’re pleased we did. We saw a very few people struggling badly who we think should have been told to stop. There are either stone or metal steps (with handrails all the way). We climbed at about 9.30 a.m. and it wasn’t too crowded but coming down we could see all the hoards going up the other side! We were very red & sweaty when we got to the top as it was a humid day with cloud which we were grateful for as the sun didn’t come out! All ages & shapes & sizes climbed the day we did it.
"This is a must if you visit Sri Lanka! I would strongly recommend taking a guide ($20) and climb to the very top. It gets quite busy and so can be a bit of a slow climb (the guide can help find short cuts) but it is well worth it. The views are astonishing, the history is amazing and it truly is the 6th wonder of the world."
"This wouldn't be so bad if humidity wasn't 80% however the 1200 steps from the bottom of the mountain does make you puff quiet a bit and you need water with you. We took the climb steadily and reached the top which had a magnificent view and we felt it was an achievement and enjoyed walking around. I must say I wondered why the stray dogs made the climb!!!. We went quiet early in the morning, which helped to avoid the heat and some of the crowd. You need to allow 2 and a half hours to climb up, walk around and climb back down. Be careful as the climb has the potential of being dangerous. It has an enormous amount of history attached to it and I was very pleased we went. Would recommend."
"We ventured an early morning climb to avoid the heat. It was still very warm! It was busy as it was a holiday weekend but in some ways this helped as the climb was slow. I am not a great one for heights but the climb had good handrails and so this didn't cause me any problems. I am 57 years old and have moderate fitness, don't let the reports of how many steps etc put you off. Take water and be prepared to be hot!"
To ascend the Lion Rock there are 1200 steep steps. There is a colony of stinging wasps at the top. You need to be very fit and to travel early in the day when the crowds are smaller
"If you are scared of heights this might be tough BUT this was a great experience - definitely prepare to walk up many steps. Also, you can’t enter after 5 pm so plan accordingly. Once you get to the top you can easily spend so much time exploring, just relaxing and enjoying the views. Bring water, wear sneakers - don’t wear a dress and sandals as I saw many tourists do!) "
"Go early in the morning to avoid the heat and crowds, its a tough climb for anyone who is not fully able...anyone with dodgy knees should give it a miss."
"We had a fantastic experience at Sigiriya. We may have done it a little differently to most, but here are some pointers if you are like us... our intention was to get to the top without too many crowds ;)"
This walk is incredible and just take your time there is no rush at all let people over take you if you want plenty of places to step to one side. 
I went up early morning. Bought my overpriced ($ 30) ticket at 7.30 am and was on the top at 8.30 am. The gardens and ruines are very well kept and certainly interesting. The climb is not a problem as long as there is no congestion. Congestion started at 9.30. It was close to Chinese newyear which explain ed the many busloads of chinese tourists. After having been in Polonnaruwa and Anahadrapura the site on top was not adding much. The view from the top was good but not as good as from Pidangula. I would not do this again.
"Visited here on Jan 20th,2019. The entire hike (both ascent and descend) takes approx 3-4 hours depending on the queue of people.While this is a UNESCO world heritage site plenty of maintenance/upkeep is needed specially at the rock/stone steps. The width/size of each step in many areas is less than a foot! How does UNESCO think normal and large footed human visitors can carefully trek here? Potential risk of falling and hurting yourself with a single misplaced foot is huge so watch out!"
"Visited here on Jan 20th,2019."
"Iconic site of Sri Lanka. Get there early as it’s cooler and much less crowded - 8 am good we had an almost unimpeded climb up ( and despite guide books mentioning vertigo inducing, it’s fine! ) By the time we came down there were queues on all stairs. The Sigiriya damsels are beautiful ( more very similar in Dambulla caves) . If you want to spend more time in the gardens after it’s a better option and you can just go back the same way ignoring the “ foreigners car park” sign ( or cut back through the Cobra cave ) Don’t miss the museum as it has a good reconstruction of the whole site and a video with ideas of what it would have looked like at different times. Oh and original photos of rediscovery of Sigiriya with terrifying bamboo scaffolding!"
"It was a great experience to climb to the top of Sigiriya - Lion Rock, the views at the top of the rock are worth it! The entrance to the Lion Rock have pretty views and plenty of monkeys."
Had a couple of days stayed sigiriya.  We went to the lion rock on Saturday. Too many people. But its was awesome trip.
"The whole site is stunning & generally well maintained & explained - very very impressive.
Definitely worth going early and avoiding the crowds - and I'd definitely not want to be over-crowded on the precipitous ladders...."
First be aware that it is 1200 steps up to reach the top.  Go early to avoid the worst crowds and heat of the day.  Amazing historical sight with much more to see than just the citadel and frescoes.
"The rock is not exceptional high and climbing is not difficult. Unfortunately, hot weather can change this perspective and reaching the top can be exhausting. Great example of ancient culture and proof of luxury wish sitting in wealthy men."
"It is such a shame, I got there around 9am and it was a local holiday so I should have known that it would be busy but really.... they let far too many people onto the rock at the same time, it really did feel that they just wanted to get as much money in as possible. If I put this to one side then the rock is impressive, the climb is manageable and the area at the top is fascinating. Some advice - once you get as far as the paintings you can choose to see the paintings (small detour) or continue up the rock, the paintings are not worth the detour, save yourself some time."
Good walk to top. Not as hard as it sounds. Give yourself 3 hours. Really worth it when you get there. 
"It's $50 to get in. Then the guide charged us the same for a 2 hour round trip. Felt terribly ripped off at the end as the guy demanded the money. Very disappointing. The grounds and the rock are very impressive though. Glad we went. Just negotiate the tour guide price beforehnd (our driver said it should be no more than 3,000R)"
Tough climb but worth it! Vertical staircase to cave with murals. Make sure you have good footwear and water.
I was surprised at the price for this place (since Sri Lanka isn't that pricey) so I was a bit sceptical if it was worth the money - but it was. We arrived late afternoon at 16:30 and decided to watch thw sunset at the top. There weren't too many tourists and thw place looked beautiful with the low-sunlight. We didn't take a guide and it took us 30 min to get to the top. It was beuatiful and stunning. We wanted to have a snack at the top but the monkeys stole our food in a second. :) I was a bit unhappy that we didn't have time for the museum.
"Early is better, we got there for 8:30 and we were up the rock within the hour, could have been quicker despite it being single file and little pockets of traffic queues. All the steps and sweat is worth it, the view is absolutely breath taking. I would say that all ages and abilities could climb/walk the rock as the steps as proper steps not a natural rock edge... there a plenty of “rest” places too on the way so if you do want to grab a quick water then you can without feeling like your holding anyone up. "
"At first I really hesitated with visiting Lion´s Rock, cause earlier that day we already climbed Pidurangala and we were told by many people that Pidurangala is enough, cause entrance fee is low and you can actually see Lion´s rock´s majestic shape from it. Anyway I decided to go for both and woow, it was so worth it.. Entrance is 25USD and it is really crowded, but that experience is unforgettable. First you walk through ruins of water gardens with turns to several caves and ancient trees and the rock is right in front of your eyes, so you have good chance to look over it in detail. The walk itself is superb and I recommend to stop at all places marked on map by the entryway of area (take photo of it). There is also some turn to abandoned hospital up the hill that I missed but I heard it is worth it too cause there are some giant memorial trees to see. Then when you reach the rock, long climb in crowd of tourists starts. In about halfway of climb there is another formation sitiing on base of the rock and there you can rest next to famous Lion Paws, stunning! My favorite part was maze of glorious terraced gardens on the top of the rock which was one of the best things I´ve ever seen and also grand 360 degree view over jungle. Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura can be seen from top in distance. Even if you are low on budget, you should really consider visiting this place cause it is a true gem of Sri Lanka and something special that you won´t see anywhere else!"

"We were fortunate to go on a cloudy day which meant it was not so hot without the sun. We also used a really good guide for the tour, which was 3000 rupees and well worth it, as he was able to give us the fascinating history of the place as we climbed the rock. The first part as you go through the gardens is flat but once you start the climb there 1202 steps to the top. If you don't like heights this probably is not for you, but if you can make it to the top it is well worth it as there are remains of the palace at the top and great views Yes it will be crowded, particularly on the last section so go early in the day, we got there at just after 0900. You will see plenty of monkeys on the way up, both in the gardens and on the top."
"As with many things in Sri Lanka ""foreigners"" pay alot more for entry but keep it in perspective it is still reasonable compared to say attractions in the UK and price is relative to income - at least foreigners get a closer car park!"
Our travel agents suggested that we start the climb at 4pm but as our driver pointed out this is the time of day when the rock is radiating at maximum after a day in the sun. The last section from the plateau is about 200 feet high and not for the faint hearted but well worth the effort. Go as early in the morning as possible - we were back down by 9.15am - and take plenty of water. There are no facilities as this is a religious place but the view from the top is stunning. Beware the men who are on hand to offer climbing assistance as they are interested only in being paid and you don't need their help but do listen to your driver/guide as the history is fascinating
"I was quite apprehensive about climbing the rock as i do not do that well with heights. The initial steps upwards climb through some great boulders and offer some great views. On the way to the Lion's claws you can either follow the mirror wall or go up the spiral staircase to see the wall paintings. The final climb up a metal staircase to the palace area at the top is a bit hairy. I am so glad i did it and i know i had to go back down but it was well worth it. The views from the top were spectacular. It was a tough climb in the hot weather, even though we went early, but felt proud. "
A lot of steps. We needed to make a few stops before we reached the top. The view on the top is worth of every step on the way there :-) 
For just 500 rps. you can climb the very nearby Pidurangale rock and that as even a stunning view. As all over Sri Lanka the enterance tickets for sights are extremely high for foreigners. 
Great experience but go early i it is a long way up but the grounds below are quite serene. Read up on the history prior to your visit to get the most out of the experience.
If you visit be sure to go early morning to avoid the crowds and the heat. Be prepared to experience quite a climb 1220+ steps. It is worth it but you need to be relatively fit. The views are awesome and well worth the trip . Be sure to wear a good pair of shoes. Be sure to have a guide it is well worth it .
"An ancient rock fortress located near the town of Dambulla. UNESCO site. The Sigiriya site contains the ruins of an upper palace located on the flat top of the rock, a mid-level terrace that includes the Lion Gate and the mirror wall with its frescoes. You need to climb 1,200 steps."
"Just to be clear, don't climb the rock if you are not prepared to effort a long and huge number of stairs. but if you do it, you will be satisfied. the park around is beautiful."
We did not have the time or energy to climb the rock so we drove to the main entrance to take a few pictures. The guard suggested that we take a half hour tuk tuk tour which would take us to a few viewpoints. It was 45 minutes before sunset but we still managed to take a few good photos of the rock.
"Superb rock fortress, get there early to beat the crowds and the heat. Downside of an early start is it can still be a bit misty at the top."
This is a fascinating place; an ancient palace on top of a hill.  My wife and I are both in our 70s but managed the climb and the view is stunning.  It is well-signposted.
"A lot of good things have been written about this place and all are true. This is a site that is unique and is really worth seeing. The reason I am writing is to encourage everyone who is afraid of heights to go because if I have been able to do it, everybody can do it. It is very safe and well done. So just go and enjoy!!!"
"If you go to Sigiriya it's a must to go to this rock, and also it's amazing and impressive looking at it and climb it. Go in the early morning"
"Beautiful the experience of visiting the citadel and climbing the Rock, it's preferable to go in the early morning because its less crowded and it's not that hot"
"We had a super time at this site, but this is because we arrived end-of-day when site had mostly emptied, if you arrive “peak” times the rock is like London Underground. We split into 2 groups: 1. Climb the rock (strenuous / sensational views) and 2. Wildlife folk (Walking the grounds/pools which were teeming with nature). Not cheap."
"What a great walk and the views going up were stunning. We went on a full moon and as the children broke up for Christmas would not recommend doing it that way , massive queues all day, but we were there early and still took a while. "
"Sigiriya is the world famous lion rock with the long history of king Kashyapa and his legacy. Frescoes middle of the rock amazing and this takes about 30 minutes to climb up, it’s worth reaching the top and taking some pictures from top and watching sunset. The views were absolutely breathtaking, only Down side is the tourists being charged 100 times more than the local price. I am not sure why the Srilanka government needs to charge this much and ripping off from the people. This is the poor strategy of Srilankan government and impact the tourism in a long term. "
Beautiful view all the way up and down! I thought the price for tourist was steep compared to the local price. Felt like I was ripped off. This could be a better if was managed better. But I would still do it again.
We made it All the way to the top 2202 steps.
The climb is pretty hard going but totally worth it. Great history and great views. 
Climbed the rock and explored the site with children (5 and 8) and we all had an amazing day. Watch out for monkeys trying to steal children’s snacks .... otherwise a perfect day :-)
That is a amazing place of architectural and beautiful prescos.you can get a beautiful view from the top of the Rock
Very amazing time of the jurney of the sigiriya.that is a ancient citadel and also beautiful prescos also.
"Nice place but highly overrated and overpriced! 
If you have been at Pidurangala ... well that is enough, the view is much more better from there! 
On the top there are some ruins but I really think the ticket is overpriced !"
Been to there for the second time and after almost 25 years. Nothing much has changed except the local tourist car park was taken a mile away. Walking from that park to the base of the rock itself is exhausting and local people better be prepared for that unless you buy a foreigner ticket. They can travel closer to the entrance and as always the poor local tourist become the second class citizen in his/her own country. It is quite impractical for old age people or kids to walk that much and climb 1200 odd steps steep uphill. I'm not sure the authorities understand this. But there is a local mafia of tuk tuks who go near the entrance without being blocked. It seems the authority has created all this by taking local park so far away and allowing these people to ride in without rules affecting other people. 
"No. 1 place to visit while you are in Sri Lanka..its UNESCO world heritage site.They have entrance fee of USD 30 for foreigners but if you are citizen of SAARC country,take your passport with you and you will get 50% discount.You must have guide with you so he can explain history and also spot some view for taking nice pictures..its more than 1200 steps and quite steep so wear proper shoes.take water bottles with you as nothing available on way."
We had read other reviews so decided to go early in an effort to avoid the crowds. We arrived at 7.45 and queued for 5 to 10 minutes to get a ticket as only one ticket booth was open. The climb although challenging took us 40 minutes although there were several rest points on the way up if you want to take it easy. It was well worth the climb as the sights at the top and the view from the top are great. On the way back down we passed many more people going up and it was getting very busy. My tip is to go early before the tour busses arrive! Ideally by 7.30.
"We went to Sigiriya Lion Rock on a family holiday to Sri Lanka. The history, the scenary and the Alfresco paintings were amazing. The best time to climb is early morning or evening. We started at 4 pm and it took 2 hours to finish the activity including the climb, photos and the descend. If you are planning an evening climb, make sure to get there before 5 pm before they close the ticketing office. Avoid full moon poya days as during public holidays the place is very crowded. A sun hat, a water bottle and hiking shoes are a must. We were puzzled by the lack of signage and amenities of the place. Nebertheless, I thoroughly recommend it to any visitor to Sri Lanka."
"Worth every bead of sweat to make it to the top, just fascinating and peaceful, not crowded at all. Don't miss it"
"The main purpose of Sri Lankan trip, just a lovely plave. 1200 step climb is a challenge but take your time, it is worth it. The top is a fascinating place - just how did they build it all those years ago?

Brilliant"
"All we know that waterfalls are started from the top of mountains. Always it gravity comes down and you would be needed to use pulling pressure technology to push water towards a mountain after they fell down. However, our Sri Lankan Kings has used the technology to bring up the water from ground floor up to the top of the rock before 7000 years ago. The simple example is Sigiriya. Sigiriya is a rocky outcrop striking geological profile which situated at Matale district above 350m sea level. It has an amazing water resource management technology within the entire site. Its technology shows work of creative nature related mechanism to bring water up to the rock call pre-eminence. The ponds of various proportion that grace the water gardens show the close affinity between the designer and natural features available at the site and also his skill. The fountains show how elementary scientific principles were used for creative work. Those fountains use both the force of gravity and pressure. The ponds in the water gardens were interconnected by a system of underground stone conduits. In certain instance, earthenware aqueducts were also used. The run-off from the water gardens in its final phase went underground and drained into the outer moat which lay beyond the inner moat. Ref. Leaflet published by Central Cultural Foundation."
This was our 3rd visit. It is originally a rock converted into a palace. It's prone to wasp attacks. But there is no recent attacks. Climbing is bit difficult if someone has hight phobia or vertigo. There are water supply system. If you don't like better to bring your own water bottles. You might get thirsty. At the top of the rock you can see pidurangala.
"The cost is USD30.00 and it is worthwhile booking your ticket online. The ticket queues were horrendous and it took us 45 minutes to get tickets, whereas the online ticket collection line was quick. Get there early (opens at 7am) as the queues of people grow quickly. The rock takes 20 minutes to climb if you don’t have holdups, but it took us about an hour to climb, and about 20 minutes on the way down. If you are not good with heights, the final stages of the climb are quite daunting, as you climb up narrow steel staircases that are attached to the sheer face of the rock. The ruins at the top of the rock are impressive and views spectacular. Wear appropriate footwear for climbing hundreds of steps and staircases."
"This is a large world heritage area that's very well maintained - it's not only the citadel itself. There are a lot of stairs involved and, on public holidays, a LOT of people (our fault - we should have gone another day). When it's full like that, it's about 3 hours to get to the top of the citadel. We didn't join the queue for that, but did spend hours in the gardens and lower levels which are lovely but that most people seem to charge straight through in their attempt to get to the top. I've got a reason to go back another time, that's not a public holiday!"
"A very popular place to visit, the ""Lion Rock"" is a must do for those who like history. Located in an open space it commands great views over the area and although there are modern spiral staircases and concrete steps taking you up to the summit, it is easy to see the original steps carved into the rock. At the top there are pools and landscaped areas and it is hard to understand how centuries ago the people of that age could developers the sight into an impregnable fortress. When visiting go early in the morning and if possible, avoid the weekend when the locals visit. Take plenty of water as there is no place to buy at the top."
"With the rock obviously the key attraction, it is still worth spending time enjoying the gardens and other features at the bottom. Recommend you do it AFTER the climb!"
"Really enjoyed climbing up to the top of the rock. Yes, you should be in reasonable shape but not an athlete. I had been apprehensive about the height given other reviews - no need it is v safe and so no heart in the mouth. Site at top very interesting- and view great."
Lots of other reviewers have described the wonders of Sigiriya and it is something not to be missed. The advice to get there early stands because it gets hotter and more crowded as the morning progresses.
We took a picnic lunch up with us an spent a good 4 hours there but others especially in groups literally walked up and around then diwn in about 2 hours. So not good value for your money
"Really enjoyed our trip up the rock, local"
This UNESCO site monument is well worth a visit we had a good guide that explained the history very well in the museum prior to the climb up the rock 
"Seen a lot of complaints about the cost for foreigners. For me, it's still value. It's worth it alone if you're into monkeys, as there are loads around who provide excellent photo opportunities. The views and the history behind the places is amazing and I personally preferred this to Chichen Itza"
"Impressive site, definitely place to visit. However, you should try to avoid visiting the place on the hot day as there are a lot of stair climbing which can be challenging for some people, especially in humid and hot weather conditions. Would also suggest to not go off the track as we saw big (probably poisons) snake just next to us. "
This place is simply amazing.
"There isnt a lot to see when you've finally survived the slow moving queues on the very narrow stairs. The foundations of the citadel still remain, but that's about it."
Sigiriya was top of our list in Sri Lanka and it was just amazing design . No surprised that it is considered as 8th world wonder and it is highly recommended .
"So many changes in 20 years. Recalling no people and the walk up a rickety rusty steel pathway of 20 years ago and what was at the top I wondered what it was like now and was it worth $30US or the 5500rupees they were charging on the day. The answer is a yes. It is now a well presented site, in that it has a few descriptions of interesting points along the way whereas Sri Lanka is normally very poor in that respect. There has been lots of excavations of walls of buildings, more ponds and water management features, more steps and not just at the bottom, the same applies to the top of the rock as well. You can now easily imagine a small city atop the rock and at the base. So all in all it is now of historical interest as well as providing excellent views. We went late in the day, starting at 3pm which was great as there was not another person buying a ticket and not many on the way up or down and allowed us plenty of time for photo stops as well as time at the top. I wouldn't want to be there at a busy time constantly queuing in the sun on steel stairs."
"Best to do this trek early in the morning, around 8 - 8.30am because there are a lot of other keen tourists."
Sigiriya is a really stunning place for tourist. There is massive rock called lion's rock.. various stories based on that.. You must visit to that place.. Entrance tiket is 30$...But no good facilities for the foreigner.. And another thing is do not take any site guide with out any one advice.. They just say some wrong information about that and take your money invain.. Thank you.. 
"Really nice park and a absoulute stunning view from the top of the rock.
Go there in the morning. The stairs are crowded. But it is Ok."
"It takes a lot of vertical steps to reach the top but the effort will be rewarded.  The frescoes, partly intact after 1500 years, are awesome.  The lion paws are impressive.  The view from the top is fantastic."
"It is really must see! And do not worry, it’s not so hard to climb in. There are several rest areas on your way up. But it is highly recommended to go there early in the morning, not on Sundays and preferably when it’s cloudy and not too hot."
"We didn't have a guide so didn't understand it all but a trip to the museum first gave us a bit of an idea.  The place was clean, and cool to walk amongst the tees."
despite the tourist crowds this was great. Going to the museum first is a good idea to gain a better understanding if you don't take a guide. Not so good if you suffer vertigo. Needs a rubbish collector to dissuade the monkeys. Our young kids 7 and 9 made it up fine
"The story telling makes this place even more special, so you should hire someone who would tell you all the things about the place and rock. One of the best experiences. Not as exosting as I expected."
"It was easier that I thought, even tho I am very afraid of height, but it was neither so difficult nor so scary as it seemed looking up. And advise is to take a guide, as without explanation it is difficult to imagine how it looked like before. The view is amazing, we where lucky with the weather. Super experience, go early morning, as you will wait more then hour on the satires in a ques."
"I'm not even sure why I'm reviewing this - it seems to be about the most famous and popular thing to do in Sri Lanka! Anyway, prepare yourself for crowds, as this place will be heaving with tourists right from the off! The place seems well organised, with a reasonably well-marked path right from the tourist ticket counter ($25pp, if you think it's too expensive then you probably need to get over yourself!) We by-passed the museum so can't comment (rain threatened on our visit and we wanted to get up to the top before it hit), but it looked interesting. We headed up and after a significant number of painful (to Adam's Peak tired legs!) steps we hit the first queue - and really, you should get used to queues at this point because the whole site is a series of bottlenecks and there'll be a lot of tourists visiting who are less fit, capable and worse prepared than you! You can bypass the spral staircases that take you up to the cave art if you like (the paintings are OK) but you'll be in queues right up until the first platform, with the lion's feet. Here it's worth waiting a few minutes to see the local monkeys inevitably stealing food from hapless tourists who think they know better! Then the next queue starts, up the steep staircases to the summit. The climb isn't too bad - you'll not be hurrying due to the bottlenecks anyway. Once at the top, the tourists spread out, and the summit is a decent sized sprawl so can accommodate large numbers pretty easily. It's worth a wander around at the top, just for the different views if nothing else! Then it's time to head down. I'd suggest taking your time and looking at the various caves, because why not while you're here? Then it's back to the conveniently placed tourist car park, via various folks selling food, drinks and tourist tat, which generally seemed a little expensive on initial inspection, though to be expected given the vast numbers of tourists and the very expenisve cameras on show! Anyway, if you're in Sri Lanka and you don't visit Sigiriya then you're an idiot (or scared of heights!), but be prepared for the crowds and you'll probably enjoy the experience a little more."
The fort was built over this rock. Now in ruins. Magnificently planned fort. Absolutely natural surroundings.
"The climb to the top may be arduous and slow if the site is busy, However once you reach the destination you enjoy the magnificent views and appreciate the history even more"
"This world heritage site is a marvel, but believe when I say it is a long hard climb to the top. On the day that we did the climb, there were massive queues and it was exceptionally humid. "
"This was one of my best personal travel experience, when you stand in front of this aesthetically pleasing wonder, you cant wait to climb upto the top. it took almost 40 Minuets to reach the rock as we started our journey from local car park. there's another alternative way to the rock which takes only 10 minuets. there are beautiful landscapes when you travel through. if you would spend your time relaxed and leasurly, then three to four hours can be your ideal time to spend here. if you are in rush, you can do this within two hours and still experience the quality of your time. It took us 40 minuets to climb to the top. Sigiriya frescoes are in the middle of the rock. make sure to pack some water with you if you dehydrate a lot."
"if you visit the World Heritage Site you will appreciate History , which shows what was done centuries ago , cannot be achieved in this era , Historians , Builders , Security , architects , name it you will be able to visualise what was destroyed and cannot be put together , loss to a nation "
"After reading other reviews we were prepared for a hard climb. We found it very reasonable and got to the top with 2 stops in 25 mins. 1200 stairs, but if you have reasonable fitness you’ll be fine. We left to go up at 730am and it wasn’t too busy. It was pretty pricey compared to other things in Sri Lanka ($30US), but it did have an amazing view. "
"My most amazing experience was climbing 1200 steps, which was a bit physically challenging, but it was worth every breath I took when I got to the top. The gardens, ponds, canals, fountains and rock paintings can also be viewed on the way to the top of the rock."
"The walk to the top was magnificent. The views are extraordinary. The climb to the top is not too hard but it’s a good idea to do this before it gets hot . Downside is that there are no warnings about monkeys targeting food from visitors and too many stray dogs . Area is generally clean , staff are friendly and helpful . English is widely spoken . Worth the trip ."
"I think that $30 to walk around a poor museum, some old gardens and climb a rock is a lot when locals are free."
As with most places in Sri Lanka it is expensive to get in and the line for purchasing tickets was long and slow.
"Pretty impressive site, worth a visit if you’re into this stuff. Easy climb and good view from the top, a few monkeys around too. I could take it or leave it though, surely there are better things to see like the Russian white whales on Unawatuna Beach. Misso was sick which made it harder, but the cokes were ice cold so we spanked that puppy. Pretty crowded, would recommend another country. Cheers"
"I read some reviews where it said it was an easy climb for all ages! Well my Mum wouldn’t manage it, but thankfully I did. It’s quite a lot of steps so I would suggest an early morning visit to avoid the heat. It’s an amazing view from the top, and bottom and well worth the calorie burn."
"This place is magnificent. It is really breathtaking view and the energy. Definitely should nead to visit, nice 3 hours. Only problem is expensive tickets but beside that it’s worth visiting. 

ps beware of monkeys:)"
"The lion monument of Sigiriya which has access to a fort right at the top. The best time to climb would be in the morning as we have around 1200 steps to reach the top. The site is a 
unesco heritage site and well maintained."
"We took a very enjoyable morning cycle around Sigiriya followed by a sunset climb. We opted to get a guide and this was well worthwhile as he was very knowledgeable and provided a wealth of fascinating information. It is hard to comprehend a 10,000 room palace with over 350 pools constructed by hand in the 5th century AD, let alone one that includes a throne at the top of Sigiriya. Do the climb!"
"Back to do the climb as a family for the 4th time in 9 years! Was well worth the trip,this time in windy but nice July weather! The museum was worth a visit before the climb itself, our boys aged 12 and 15 find all the steps and monkey sightings still as fun as ever! The history, pretty amazing location as well as the views at the top make this a very unique cultural experience, though not for people who have trouble with heights/vertigo... Having said that we saw many a grandmother in flipflops making the climb with big smiles on their faces!! So, yes, its all about the experience, you won´t regret it!!"
"We came early in the morning to avoid the crowds, we were there before 7.30am and there were already a few people there, but not too bad. We went up and down in less than 2hs, it was ok, but considering other places in Sri Lanka we thought it as a bit overrated and overpriced (US$30 per person). We also did the rock across, where you only pay 200 rupees and have the same (or a better) view and the climbing is much more fun (and challenging)"
Ubable to climb for personal reasons but very impressive. The diaroma I saw gave a good overview of the rock and the explanation on construction and why was good
Overpriced (30$per person) but since you are here don't miss it. 
"One of the biggest and well planned kingdoms in Sri Lanka. Many tourists just climb the rock and go, but there are many more archeological facts and sites to explore in the peripheral area of the rock. If you want to visit better to avoid weekends because of the croud. The near by forested areas also good for birding."
This site is pretty awesome but be prepared for a lot of people. We came to the museum where the tickets are sold for foreigners couple of minutes after 7 am and found a long line for the tickets. After about 20 minutes we could start our climb with many other people so forget about nice pictures of you alone standing in front of the rock.
It is beautiful site but I have to admit that you need to be in a very good shape to climb 1200 steps. There are local who wants to assist elderly people all the way to the top but negotiate the price before (1000) rupies. 
"Ancient urban city on one rock, four swimming pool complex, water fountain 600 years ago, water drainage system, fire bricks foundation on the rocks and the ultimate palace of the king and queen on the lions rock. All amazing. It’s a must visit once you are in Sri Lanka. "
"This is very cool and well worth a visit. Be prepared for tight calves the next day or 2 as there are a quite a few stairs to climb. We hit quite a number of tourists but, if you avoid following the hordes headed straight for the summit, you can take a left or right to see what a lot miss and take some time to soak it up. Stunning."
"This is a marvelous site, however I was not able to climb to the top.There are just too many locals who insist on helping you ( for income ) up the steps that it is overpowering. I made it up to stage one where the steps without any safety or railing made me cease any further climb. Very few in my opinion make the journey to the top. ( maybe 10% ) Carry & drink lots of water."
"We arrived at 7.15 am, we had seen pictures of long queues which were not for us. By arriving early we went straight to the ticket desk, it was still cool for the climb, there was no cloud so the view was clear, there were few people about so we could take the long path to the rock and take pictures undisturbed. The climb itself was only a small challenge, the view from the top was fabulous looking down on the gardens and further afield across the jungle. We had not realised the size of the buildings/ruins at the top and the enormity of what had been here."
"We arrived here at 3 pm which is the perfect time to reach the top just in time for sunset. It is not too hot and the sunset view is amazing. Also it is better to give it a 3 hrs tour just so that you take your time and enjoy and not be in a rush. We initially thought ticket price is too high (30 usd/person) but after visiting it was totally worth the money. The place is huge, super green, and the views are amazing. I felt totally Zen here and took some incredible pictures. DO NOT miss this if you come to Sri Lanka!!!"
"This rock is the main attraction of Sigiriya, which houses ancient palace ruins atop a hill - the lion rock. There are about 1250 steps and would take about 1.5 hours to reach the top. The climb is worth it. The ticket price may make you think again, but should go for the climb. Also read along the technology that they had to get the water atop. "
"Amazing views - but get there early for a 7 am start!  It's a bit of a hike but well worth it, the frescoes are incredible also."
We stood in a line all the way to the top. The view was okay but we preferred nearby piturangalla. Definitely come early and get your driver to buy tickets in advance if you visit during peak season
"While on a family vacation, knowing we love nature and walking around this site presented all what we could aspire for: History, Nice scenery, Average difficulty Hike (1200 steps in phases) and breathtaking scenery!! I strongly recommend for those who like to move and enjoy nature "
"the ticket sale is a mess, only 3 counters open and one for vouchers only (who and where could you get a voucher?), queueing absolutely caotic, we were there at 7am but had to queue 1 hour for tickets, and then 2 hours to get on the top of the rock...avoid holiday time christmas/new year! many locals are visiting then. beware: chines groups don't respect any rules and lines or queues. the organization in the park should be improved, above all at the entrance and ticket office, it is unbearable! and expensive enough...museum is nice and worth visiting after the rock."
No doubt that you must see this site if you are physically able to climb the steps.
"The climb is all stairs, but not that difficult.  Bring water with you and take many breaks.  Once you reach the top, the views are breathtaking!"
"This is definitely worth a visit if you are in this area of Sri Lanka. The museum and gardens are nice and the museum gives you a good idea of what the top of the rock looked like when first built and habited. This makes the climb and discovery of the peak even more enjoyable, so don’t be tempted to skip the museum."
"Clearly this is a must do in Sri Lanka: a beautiful and awe-inspiring experience, and well worth the climb. Not recommended if you have mobility problems or vertigo as the stairway is steep, slippery (especially if it is raining) and feels quite precarious in places. Workplace health and safety officers from other countries would shudder! As you climb, look at some of the footholds carved into the steep rock and marvel at the inventiveness, skill and bravery of the builders of this monument. Go as early as you can to avoid the heat and crowds, or getting stuck behind a large slow tour group - the ticket office opens at 7.00am. Be sure to take plenty of water too."
"Really nice, once you're at the top. We arrived at 11 which was a terrible time, and consequently the ascent was in a v busy crowd aNd took 2 hours."
From my Blog:
This is a must visit place if visiting Srilanka!! Although you need to be fit to climb those steep stairs of around 1200 stairs. Also it is recommended to go during the sunset hours or early morning.. otherwise it will be too sunny during rest of the hours in a day.. 
"We went to Lion Rock a couple days ago, we were quite shocked to find out that entry was 30 dollars per person, which is a massive markup to what the locals pay. "
"Lets start off with a statement. Entry fee for tourists in 30$ which is quite pricey for climbing a rock... but worth it nontheless. 

The view was great but I'd advise getting a guide with you."
"Driver took us and we organised a local guide in the car park. Me, scared of heights didn’t go up the rock but guide took my wife and 2 children up. Took about 2 hours and he explained everything to them. He was great. There was more than enough to keep me exploring around till they came back down. (You don’t need a guide for this). "
"We left our hotel in Dambulla at 6am and had no problems with queues, were so glad we did as there was loads of people coming up as we came down. Take water, hat, sunscreen, wet wipes to get the rust from the final hand rails off your hands and use the toilets at the bottom as there are no facilities after this.It would be too hot later in the morning. The views were spectacular and it was well worth the climb and early start. Parts could be challenging if you don't like heights. We had a guide with us."
"We went to Sigiriya at around 9 am on 27th Dec because our driver (someone who had no idea about anything - we realised later on our trip) said it would be OK. We arrived and the queue to climb the rock was ~2 hrs. We decided to hire a guide -the loveliest guide, and very knowledgeable as he has been doing the tour since he was 20 yrs old+~40 yrs experience- He took us through the best shortcuts but even though we decided to go back again the following day. He met us the following day at 6:45 am and we managed to be the first ones at the top of the rock. During the day before and after going down from the rock our guide was explaining everything and all our questions very professionally. He even took us to Sigiriya temple. He only goes up once per day so we is not in a hurry to finish the tour with you to take other tourists. "
The climb wasn't difficult and the view once at the top was breathtaking. The history and the incredible architectural ingenuity was very interesting. The fort had various security features. Too date there are still crocodiles in the moat surrounding the fort. The rip off is the charge foregone ras pay in comparison to the locals. 
"Yes, it is pricey, but the place is well-maintained and I'm ok with paying more than Sri Lankans to see it. "
Get organised be early need to avoid the crowds as can take up to 3 hours. Very hard climb in the heat with limited space steps very narrow. We climbed in the rain. Definitely cooler and less crowded. BUT metal steps were slippery. Highly recommend.
"The gardens are beautiful, while you walk towards the rock. Climbing of the rock is a challenge, but we succeeded. From the Lions stairs up to the palace it is really fabulous."
It’s a nice place to visit when you travel to Sri Lanka. I recommend this attraction. It cost about lkr 4500.
A must do if coming to Sigriya albeit as with a lot of other entrance fees it is a little pricey. We started early getting there for 7am and actually it wasn't very crowded at all at that time and it was find going up and down. we took our time at the top although it was starting to get pretty busy as we were leaving. Also best to get there early as its starts getting pretty hot too. I thought it was worth doing and we enjoyed it.
Not much to add to numerous other reviews.
"Nice views, a little scary but it's part of the fun. Only negative is you pay over 90 times the locals do for the entrance fee. If you can afford it, it is a good way to exercise. Enjoyed the hike and view. Tourists feeding monkeys were not good for them,"
Since we visited during last week of December(probably the peak season) we had to wait 1 hour for ticket and a big queue to climb. 
Visited on Christmas Day.
The views from the top are stunning. The climb is taxing but very slow due to the numbers of visitors and limited access staircases. Not for the fainthearted or those with a serious fear of heights although it is all via stairways nowadays. Opens at 7 am and the earlier you can get there the better as the crowds flood the rock from quite early.
"A Terrific experience. Get there early, opens at 7.  Be there then, otherwise queues are huge. The views are spectacular at the top"
"£50 to climb and locals pay way less.
Everyone in on scam no staff to deal wit crowds .
Only matter of time before a serious incident.
They need to set up better health & safety standards"
So we booked this through our hotel in Colombo which after paying for told us it would cost us 7000 to climb the rock. Bearing in mind it took us 7 1/2 in traffic because the drive crazy no rules .
It’s a must to visit the Lion rock and the surrounding gardens - a lovely place! Try to go there when they open at 07.00am to avoid the crowd and take the walk before the sun is to warm.
"This was awesome, but exhausting after being pushed and shoved through the line with thousands of local familes, who were all super nice but all over me. I would highly recommend every going to Sri Lanka to stop here for a day, bring some food in and have a little picnic at the top, or maybe sneak some in, im not sure if they allow :)"
"Having arrived later afternoon we were able to climb the rock and enjoy the late afternoon views ... like other reviewers have noted this is definitely not a climb for the faint hearted as in parts the stairs claws into the rock to get you to the top. Also like others we had a guide thrust upon us - we were fortunate to only have to pay 3,000 LKR after reading about fees of around 1,500 LKR and did so to get him to go away ... his commentary was not that great and we of course were shown the shortcuts (including a couple where his mates were selling items) ... a great day and expensive ... but fun ... be brave and when the guide starts just say NO ... "
"Met by a tour guide. Our driver told us it would be 2500LKR. So all good. Set off. Very informative guide. Took us on a couple of short cuts to avoid the queues. Essential that you get there before 7:30am. Do not attempt if you have the faintest hint of vertigo as the stairs literally hang on to the rocks. There is lots to see and it was very interesting. I had already read a brief history of the rock and palace which the guide just repeated. At the end of the tour he demanded 11,000LKR or US$50. Which was clearly a total rip off. We ended up paying him just to get rid of him. Our driver was horrified at what had happened. Totally spoilt our trip here and has made me view the people here quite differently. "
We reached the ticket counter around 10.30am which was probably too late to miss the crowds. Tickets were usd 30 and they only take cash (no card). 
"Brilliant day trip for all the family! So beautiful at the top. It is quite a popular attraction though and it gets very crowded- we queued all the way up and it took us just over two hours to reach the top compared to about 10 minutes to get down. For someone who hates queues and crowds though, it wasn’t too bad and well worth the wait at the top! Don’t forget a camera. "
An absolutely awe inspiring place to visit. The grounds are stunning and really well maintained. 
This climb is not as hard as it looks. Definitely do it later in the afternoonwhrn it's a bit cooler and try catch the sun setting. If the day is clear its really pretty.There is a place you can stop near the top if you get too tired. I would recommend seeing the top though. Definitely worth the effort.
"We have just returned from our walk up Sigiriya. We arrived just after 8am thinking that would be early enough to avoid the queues....but not quite! Tickets for foreigners cost 30 USD per adult and 15 USD for children under 12. Tickets must be paid for in cash. There is an ATM about 5 minutes walk away. We waited in line for about 45 minutes for tickets. Depending on your circumstances - it may be worth sending someone (eg a driver) ahead for tickets. The line to start the climb was long and fairly slow moving which was a real challenge in the heat / humidity. We were probably in the line for about 30 minutes before taking up the offer of a ‘shortcut’ from a local, for a price of course. We ended up rejoining the line further up which was still fairly slow moving and pretty warm. There was one area that had some lovely frescos. Eventually we made it to the top and enjoyed the view. The walk down took a little bit of time as well as you share the stairs with people heading up. Watch out for the monkeys on the way up and down - they will grab any snacks within reach. Overall I’m glad I did the walk and I think we were lucky as we were able to complete it within a few hours - including queuing time!"
The most fascinating thing about this place is to remember how they got up there in the old days. You can still see the old steps in the rock. It would have been a crazy climb.
"So I went just after the ticket counter opened. There where already quite some people but it was still fine. Made my way up. Saw the view walked around a bit. Made it down again. But it was a okay expierence. I liked the walk, the view was good for the rest it was mediocre."
$30 US per person to climb the hill is extortionately expensive comparative to what the locals pay as well as general costs for other things in the area such as food and accommodation. To put into perspective it would have cost us more to climb this thing than the two nights we stayed in a local guest house. There is another similar climb nearby that is only 500 LKR per adult. We took that option instead. 
"Where do I begin, to tell the story of Sangiriya tourist sight of Sri Lanka. Famed for its remarkable views and history, it is a place about 80km from Kandy, which sounds pretty near but takes about 3-4 hours by car to get there as the average pace through the towns between is 10-30km/hr. If one were to arrive at the sight before 9am, this would be the only way to avoid a 2 hour long que moving at snail pace to somehow get to what you think is the top, but in fact is just a way to slow down the entire journey. After reaching this half way point, you again have to stand in a que for about 30mins - 1 hour to get to the top view point. Which would be great if that was all the waiting to be done, but then after seeing a pretty average view, you will need to wait yet another queue to get back down to the bottom for another 30mins-1hour. Now this would all be ok if it is not above 33 degree Celsius weather in a spot with literally no personal space, packed like sardines with some who have negotiable hygiene standards, and with kids and grandmothers alike trying to climb this fashionably steep set of stairs all the way up and down, often holding the queue’s at a standstill with their families trying to convince them to take another step forward. So for those who think that this will be an adventure of a lifetime, think again...be prepared for hours of standing in a tightly packed queue for hours on end, in the heat, for a very average view of trees and couple of lakes. If you don’t believe me, see the photos below. If you insist on visiting this spot my advice would be to go at 8am which would require you to leave kandy or Colombo at 5am at the very latest or just find a place to stay near by the night before. Otherwise plan for an entire day on the road in traffic and in queues."
Entrance Fees: USD 30
"Thank goodness we got there before opening time, as we could walk up the steps with minimal wait times (around an hour with minimal fitness level). However, upon seeing the queue to get up the rock once back down at the ground we realized what a fortune is being made through the pockets of foreign tourists, the queue was insane (we ran into a tourist who went 90 mins later than us and they took 3 hours to get to the top due to the number of people), well past the Boulder rocks towards the lower gardens. We reflected on the price of admission and what we received for that and agreed that the $US30 cost is absolutely ridiculous, when you consider the price of entry to natural attractions in other countries and when also taking into account the minimum wage in Sri Lanka is about $US55 per month. In the end we ticked off this tourist attraction, but it was absolutely tainted by feeling that we had been scammed on the entry cost."
"We visited Sigiriya at the end December. Surprisingly there was not too many western tourists but really a lot of local people. We wanted to climb to top of rock, but there was enormous que and we gave up after sawing that. Not worth of waiting for hours under hot sun to get to rock. Also price (30 $) seemed far too much (specially compared with locals price of 0,5 $)"
We bought 30$ tickets (which is very expensive in comparison to other similar attractions in Sri Lanka and elsewhere in the world) and we weren’t able to climb the rock because of 6-8 hours cue faced at the entrance of the rock. The cue was due to thousands of people let in without caring that the people inside were already way too much.
This was my third climb and still found it exciting. The rock paintings are beautiful and the view from the top is gorgeous. It's good for history buffs as well.
"The locals pay 50 for a ticket ( 0,20 $). Tourists pay 5k (30 -$). I’m sorry but I’m not going to pay that amount of money. I do understand that tourists should pay more, but I would expect maybe twice or five times the sum. This feels like a major rip off! "
We visited Sigiriya rock in December during our trip in Sri Lanka. Although it was extremely crowded (2-3 hours to go up and the same to go down- also due to pick season and holidays) our guide helped us with skipping part of the queue. His English is very good and he is extremely knowledgeable. He stopped us on the way to some local markets with Delicious food and also some secret temples. It was the best experience we had in Sri Lanka due to him.
"Home of a former king of Sri Lanka, who built his royal palace atop this 350m high rock, surrounded by a moat and landscaped gardens dating from 5th century. Archeologists have also found remains of a pre-historic settlement dating from around 5000BC. Entry for foreigners costs 30USD for adults and 15USD for children up to 12 years old."
"We visited this beautiful place recently. But on reaching there, we found that if you are from a SAARC country, you must carry your Original Passport to avail 50% discount for entry ticket. It's steep 30 USD for all foreign visitors. But for SAARC residents it's 15 USD only and only if you produce your original passport at the ticket window. No digital or photocopies would suffice. We didn't know this fact. Eventually we avoided the climb of this 1200 steps and rather took a TukTuk auto rickshaw ride around the periphery which was simply a great fun. Even if you climb the Sigiriya rock, you Must take this TukTuk ride. Without that, your trip will not be worthwhile. People with knee pains should avoid the climb of this uneven 1200 steps."
"To climb up the rock is quite demanding and you need some fitness to get up tp the top. However, as a Swiss we are used to mountains and rocks. Get there in the morning, the stone is heated up very quickly. Once up there, you have a nice view into the countryside. "
Walking up the stairs to the top of the Lion Rock is not as hard as one may think.
"The cost is supper exaggerated for the tourists. The locals pay $0.30 and the foreigners pay $30. The place is worth it, but the difference between the local and foreign tourist is an insult. I was extremely upset for this. They compare and match their prices with the prices in USA and other Western European countries. What they ignore is the fact that if we charge that amount it is a necessity because we pay the workers a minimum $10 per hour, but they pay theirs around $5 per day. So all the money go to the state, not to the workers."
"Great location. Need to climb up. Also call as Lions Rock. Archeologically important place. Can see the ancient caves, frescoes.
A must visit place in Sri Lanka"
"It’s worth of gng to this place . We need to climb 1300 steps approximately to reach the top. Amazing view and we can see few left paintings. If u r from India , please carry ur passport , we will charged only 15US dollars else we will be charged 30US dollars. Most of the heritage places in Srilanka, we will charged, so carry passport to get a discount. "
"Lovely to visit but would recommend going early to avoid the crowds! We went with our driver/guide and he was very knowledgeable, I’d recommend reading up before you go if you are going without a guide. The history is fascinating. The views are superb too. "
"Went with my wife for the nutural sight watch 
How the biuld such a rock as a fortress on those ancient time"
"We arrived at the gate around 8am. It opens at 7:30, and already the parking lot was filling up and there was a 15 minute line to buy the tickets which were $30USD per foreign adult. This is very expensive by Sri Lanka standard!"
It is a very beautiful rock/mountain carved and built by kings 100s of years ago. It is a little hard to climb all the way up though  especially in the hot sun. Better to climb early morning before the hot sun makes it lot harder.
I travelled to Sigiriya with my wife and 2 children during what was supposed to be the dry season in late December. We paid a driver to take us on a 2 hour trip each way from Matale.
"As recommended by all guides, since the grounds open at 7 am, you’d better be there around that time, if you want to enjoy your ascent to the top. Before starting the trek I’d suggest a visit to the museum. At the very least, read the small leaflet which contains all the info you may need. It is astonishing to think that this amazing fortress was actually used for less than 20 years, before being reconverted into a monastery and then abandoned."
"It takes some time to climb the stairs to the top, and can be challenging if travelling with children as we did, but the views are great from the top. Both our children liked the experience and great for photos. On the way up there are some interesting spots, but not much information available, so guess we were lucky to have a guide with us to explain some things as it made it more interesting. A must to visit if in Sri Lanka and Sigiriya, and the place have interesting history, but would not visit more than one time."
"The rock is amazing! The walk on top is quite challenging but our 5 years old daughters managed to do that (steps steps steps). Next time I would climb at the evening to take good pictures of the rock with sun behind me. We met many monkeys on our way, non-aggressive, but one stole the wafer directly from my hand :-)"
I understand that there's a special price for tourists but charging USD30 to be able to walk all the way up is excessive. For that price I was expecting accurate information about the ruins and what I was looking at. Unfortunately there was almost none. 
"Also known as the ""8th Wonder of the World"", Sigiriya is one of the most valuable historical monuments of Sri Lanka. It reaches 660 feet in height, and the ruins of the late king Kashyapa's fortress complex boasts a significant archaeological importance. Due to its uniqueness and the amazing combination of urban planning and constructions, it was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982."
The climb will take you around 1 hour if you do a brisk walk. It really gets windy on the top and some portions of the stairs do not have railings so you would feel a little uncomfortable. Make sure you don't give up as you have an amazing view from the top. Avoid the sun and go early.
"This is one of the most famous and popular tourist destinations in Sri Lanka. There are several different levels to climb and ancient frescos to view if you climb high enough. Unfortunately, I was was not able to make it to the top. The heat, humidity, and crowds got to me, as well as the uneven steps and lack of handrails which raised my concerns about safety. If you should choose to do the climb, go early, bring water, and be sure you have acclimated to the climate."
"It is definitely a place worth to visit. Before climbing the Rock, I was worried.... didn’t expect to be that easy. The trick for those weak person like me is: walk leisurely and enjoy the view and the historical points slowly and don’t rush. Up and down takes not more than 4 hrs leisurely. We spent about 1 hour on top.... total of about 5hrs."
Alot of steps to climb and the view is very nice. The greenery is beautiful and good history that has been well maintained.
Must visit place in Sigiriya. Enjoyed every minute spend here. The stairs to the top looks never ending but the view on the way and on the top is breath taking. The remains of the rock fortress is great to explore and leaves us wondering how it was constructed a millennium and a half back. I do not think this place is kids friendly. People from SAARC nations please carry your passport to get 50% discount on the entrance fee which is 30USD as on Dec 2018.
We knew Lion rock was the renowned landmark in the area but it was truly a spectacular experience and historic site! 
"Well worth the effort  of climbing to the top.  The views are fantastic although the climb up the stairs fixed to the outside of the rock will scare lots of people.

Very expensive at $50pp but i enjoyed the experience and views"
Very hot and exhausting climb up the rock in very humid conditions.  Great photo opportunities when you eventually reach the top!
"A great way to spend 2-3 hours. You don’t need a guide, simply buy tickets (US$30) and enjoy the walk up - lots of steps but not arduous in any way - my watch told me I had climbed 40 flights of steps when I reached the summit. Go early is my recommendation - so that you are not ‘stuck’ behind the package yours that tend to turn up about 0800 onwards. We walked up at opening time - 0700 - and it was perfect - not too busy and pleasant temperature. Once on top, it is interesting to explore the ruins of the old Royal palace and it provides some good views and photo opportunities. "

"We climbed the rock on a Friday around 3 pm. It took us less than 1 hour. We are not in great shape but we do exercise. The climb is not tough. I recommend your take tour time and take a look around as you go up and down. There are some monkeys around certain areas, but they were not interested in people. Fun activity and a must see while in Sri Lanka. "
"This is a landmark for miles around and looks impossible to climb. But fear not: there are good steel steps and handrail up the cliff, and if you're really bothered by heights you can stop at a large level resting area under the final ascent.Those with bad knees would be helped by walking pole or poles on the steps of the lowest part where there isn't always a handrail. I was stunned - and happy - to view a sea of forest all around when I'd heard that Sri Lanka has lost half its original forest with consequent loss of habitat for elephants and everything else wild. The site gets busy, so best to start very early."
"To be on Sri Lanka trip and not to see this, would be a big loss. The history feeling is on every corner here. Quite expensive (30USD per person) but in the end totally worth it."
Must do activity in Sri Lanka. It will only take 1 1/2 hrs to climb the rock. Best time to start in the morning before the rock gets hot with the sun or the evening after 3
Definitely visit here. Th history of the rock is interesting and has well preserved paintings on the rock of ‘beautiful women’ (so said the tour guide!)
"This was our last stop before leaving Sri lanka. Really nice view, funny apes. Also it was beautyful when you got up there and took a seat watching those stunning views, cant forget that..."
"The Sigiriya World Heritage Site is unique, is amazing, it is one of the main historical sites of the country and one of the reasons we came to Sri Lanka. The view of the colossal rock raising up in the middle of the forest, the fortress/palace build on and into it, the amazing frescos of the ""Sigiriya Ladies"" in terrace half way to the top, the lion paws at one of the entrances, other caves and carvings, the view from the top of the rock, all make for an wonderful experience, not to be missed..."
"Sigiriya rock fortress was a palace built in the 4th century AD and later used as monastery till the 13th century. It was discovered again only in the 19th century. All this, the history and the layout plan are given in the brochures you can pick up in the ticketing room. We didnt get a guide as we wanted to do things at our pace. There is a long walk by the moats and the water gardens begore you get to the steps. You dont need to be very fit to climb them as you can stop at several points to recover. The steps are not steep but can be a challenge for those with knee problems. However the 1200 steps up is worth it. Its a beautiful view, you can see the remnants of the palace walls. And the view from the top shows you the layout at ground level too. There is a huge Buddha statue directly opposite the palace some kms away, which you can appreciate only after you have climbed up. Take water along."
"This site - the features of the runs on Lion Rock itself and the surrounding site - is one of the wonders of ancient Asia and should be on everyone's list of top 3 places to in Sri Lanka even if you're there for a beach break. We had not even heard of the site before researching our trip but it is, in its way, as amazing as(albeit much more compact than) Ankor Wat."
"The climb wasn’t as strenuous as I’d expected, even in that heat. Don’t get me wrong, we were hot and sweaty(!) but not physically exhausted. There are a series of stone steps first, then metal ones before you reach the lion paws which are about two thirds of the way up. Some of the steps are rather exposed so if you have a fear of exposure you may find it difficult. It also gets very crowded and you have to pass people coming the other way on the same staircase. Once you’re on the top the views are incredible. You can see for miles. There’s not much shade up there, just a handful of trees - take a hat and don’t forget the sun cream. Well worth it! Don’t miss the cobra stone on the way back"
It absolutely poured on the day we climbed the rock but it was worth it. The climb was really strenuous but there are enough landings to rest on if you get out of breath. Once at the top and the cloud lifted to give amazing views. 
"The rock fortress at Sigiriya is formidible. The site is very extensive, with moats and water-gardens preceeding your pathway to the rock fortress itself, which suddenly looms up 200 meters out of the plain. You enter via a gateway guarded by two massive paws - apparently belonging to a lion once carved on to the rock-face - and from that point on, the climb is ever upwards by rickety stairs winding round the rock-face and quite steep in places. Warning - The climb should not be attempted by those who have difficulties walking or stair-climbing unaided - there are about 1,800 -odd steps, and in the heat, with high humidity, it can be quite tiring and exhausting. And ignore the ""friendly"" locals who offer to help you climb up - they are of no use at all but will still demand $20 from you!. About half-way up is the ""mirror wall"" and the paintings of the Sigiriya ladies - these are worth all the effort - but NB: they can be closed to the public if hornets decide to build their nests there, as they do from time to time. The view from the top is magnificent, and stretches over the surrounding plain, so you can see why it was ideal as a fortress. There is even a swimming pool at the top! The site was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982."
"Let's start with the problems, it's really overpriced, but not well kept. If you have a fear of hight or prone to vertigo, you should consider, that the last part with the stairs might effect you uncomfortably. For me it's a problem, so I just watched the stairs and where put my feet, didn't looked around or down."
It is not cheap but very well looked after and just a wonder to look at location views and effort to build. Go early as gets busy and I would not want to be climbing all the way up the steps in a queue and queue all the way down.... 
So it is an early start but up for six and leaving dambulla means we are some of the first to get to Sigirya at 7.02. We crack on and get to the top well before 8. Several moans on the way from my partner about the pace. If you are not fit take your time worth the trip to the top but there is a first aid tent half way for a reason. We are the second couple at the top. It is quiet and mistical. The views are amazing even with the mist in the valleys all around. The you come down and explore the gardens you has seen from above.. all by 10. The gardens are so well looked after worth the money to get in.Worth the early start just to miss the crowds. As we leave there are cues all the way up...... next stop Pidurangala Rock to look back on the rock we just climbed... It was 10860 lkr but worth it. 
The Rock looks overwhelming.....too awesome n climbing it feels impossible.But the steps make the daunting task a child's play...n thrilling once you make it.Cant imagine the struggles that people of yore made to build a palace on top and the patience they had to live there climbing up and down day in and day out.The maze of fountains and ponds make it all the more wonderful.
It’s an ancient palace and there are stairs up to the top. Go early in morning to avoid rush and heat. You get good view from the top. Carry water.
"There are ruins on the top that shows once it was a fortress of King Kasyapa (477 – 495 CE) at a height of about 200 m. Entry fee 30 USD for foreigner but for Asian it is 15 USD, you are to show the passport. Though it is about 200 m high, well railing and nice iron steps will make the journey easy, last part little stiff but with caution you can reach there. The view from the top is excellent. There are little water pool, old stairs and different room compartment ruins. No shop is there on it's way so keep your water with you. In the midway, some part you are climb through a spiral iron stair for seeing the old cave paintings Entry fee for foreigners too high in everywhere in Srilanka. In some places local people pay only LKR-60 but foreigners pay LKR 1500 which looks very injustice. Approximately 2 hours will be required. Another similar rock pidurangala is little away from it can be seen from the top. The path diversion is there that when you come down will reach to another side exit. Overall looked very attracting."
"Always will get excellent experience..should nominate word number one wonder.............
Car paking area need to develop"
The climb can be very tiring especially if the sun is burning hot! Make sure you go on a day that its not raining! It has 360 degrees of amazing views! The forest seems endless from the top! Truly amazing! Take a hat and a bottle of water with you and wear comfortable shoes
Very impressive fortress with fantastic views from the top. it isn't an easy climb to the top but there were quite a few people the day we went so the climb was quite slow.
Not an easy climb if you're not in shape but could do it slowly. No rush. Amazing views on top! Worth the effort
"I climbed the rock 15 years ago, in the pouring rain and low cloud, so saw very little from the top, which was the only reason why I wanted to do it again. There is now a good museum, and of course the nice gardens, but you find yourself itching to start the climb. It's not really too hard if you take it at your own pace, The stone steps at the start are tricky as there is no handrail, but further up it is easier as it's mostly ladders and steps with rails. If you struggle (as my friend did) there are ""guides"" who will help you to climb. Hers was very pleasant and patient, and gave us a lot of information as we went up. However, BEWARE. When we got back down, he expected a LOT of money, and it quite took the edge off the day when he was scathing about his tip (2000 rupees, approx. £10)."
"The Lion Rock is an amazing place but unfortunately there are way too many tourists especially the elderly yet unfit ones taking their own sweet time climbing those flight of stairs. An important note: Do avoid touts & self-claimed official helpers around the vicinity. We were approached by one despite saying ‘no,’ he insisted on following us then demanded 40 USD for his service!!! "
"- As i mentioned this is a world heritage site which was located near Dambulla, Sri Lanka."
"Our family visited Sigiriya, Lion Rock. We are a group of 4 with 2 young boys, 7 & 5. We had a guide Neel who gave us interesting information along the way. We arrived a little over 8am and climbed up and down and left after 1030am. Nice viewings of wall paintings and the mirror wall. Lion gateway was another interesting stop. Our 5 year old made the 1200 steps and we enjoyed the views at the top."
"My wife had not made it to the top on a previous visit. So, this time, with the staircase and the help of a guide, she got there. I guess I should be grateful. But when I first climbed, there were foot ledges and hand-holds."
"Sigiriya is one of the main reasons we came to Sri Lanka, it is an amazing, unique and beautiful place. It actually is a citadel built by King Kashyapa during the 5th century AD. The site contains the ruins of an upper palace located on the flat top of the rock, a mid-level terrace that includes the Lion Gate and the mirror wall with its amazing frescoes of the ""Sigiriya Ladies"" (apparently there were 500 such ladies when the place was completed) and the lower palaces located behind the lower gardens, moats and ramparts which protected the citadel. The site was both a palace and a fortress and it will amaze you. Do not let the climbing of the 1200 steps discourage you - you'll have a metal cable/bar to hold on at all times and ,,, it's not that bad,,, All together, an experience not to be missed."
"Fantastic site to visit. Best to arrive early and prepared for the climb, which is about 2 hours if you take it steady. Lovely views"
"- As i mentioned this is a world heritage site which was located near Dambulla, Sri Lanka."
"Go as early as you can.The light is beauttiful,it s cooler and after 9 the queues are massive ! Take lots of water"
"AMAZING!! A tough hike, especially on a warm day, however, the views from the top are well worth it. Probably worth getting a guide if you are keen to learn the history. Would recommend doing Pidurangla after Lion's Rock. Take lots of water!"
A really nice walk which if gone early (7am) is not too hot or busy.
"Interesting - lots of history, gardens & a lot of steep steps."
"This is a stunning place. Costly for “foreigners” around $30 US. The climb is well worth it and the frescoes amazing. Recommend going through the museum first if you don’t know too much about the site. There is very little shade so definitely, hat, sunscreen and lots of water. The rock is about 1200 steps and the water garden and grounds are also outstanding."
"It’s hard to ignore the fact that it’s incredibly overpriced (not entirely sure where the money goes, as noticed a few information signs were so worn they were illegible). Other than that, it’s a beautiful site and the grounds are well maintained. Recommend getting there for when it opens as super quiet, otherwise it gets ridiculously crowded. Not too strenuous to get to the top, but some people might have issues. Touts and guides seemed to ignore us but saw them prey on others. "
"The area surrounding the Lion Rock has been very well maintained with well laid paths, lined with trees, a lake which also has crocodiles, a restaurant and the Museum A good place to spend time."
"The place has huge historical significance. It is supposed to have been a monastery but some people claim that it was the palace of Ravana, the ancient king of Lanka during Ramayana time."
A fantastic climb to the top to get a sense of how the city was and for spectacular views of the surrounding area. Take plenty of water and some snacks for when you reach the summit. There is quite a bit of orange dust from the rocks so wear something that won't be spoiled by it. The museum is located with the ticket counter and has an interesting model of how the city might have been.
"As part oof our tour of Sri Lanka, we visited the Sygiria Lion Rock. Whilst I had seen videos on YouTube, nothing prepares you for the scale of this climb. I often suffer with vertigo, so this was going to be a challenge for me, but once I reached the top, I was so elated. The spectacular views, and the incredible ruins of an ancient palace were awe inspiring to think what was achieved without modern machinery over 1600 years ago. Definitely worth doing if you are in Sri Lanka for a holiday!"
"They charge locals 50 LKR, and tourists 6
5500 LKR, which is pretty insane but even with that it’s an amazing place. Very good for sunset and leaves you kinda in awe.
It could be one of the wonders of this world"
"How this was built and how they managed to carry the king to the palace at the top boggle the mind. Be prepared to sweat and cope with heights and steep stairs, but equally be prepared to see some beautiful and fascinating sights"
"Sigirya Rock such a wonderful surprise. We stayed just 20 minutes away from it and the visit was just amazing. The view, the monkeys and all the rest was just super nice. If you visit Sri Lanka this is definitely a place to visit."
"I'll keep this short and suite. 

Just go. 

One of the best places I've had the fortune to visit. Really is jaw dropping"
If you're quite unfit or have no head for heights at all then you might want to think twice about this but you can't beat the views from the top. My tips: take plenty of water up there and go early before it's too hot and crowded.
"A beautiful heritage site ruined by pushy,annoying “guides” from the moment you step off the bus. This should be stopped as it just puts you off. "
Climbing the Lion Rock was the highlight of my stay in Sigiriya. I arrived there around 7:45 am and getting there as early as possible was a great decision. Here are few good reason.
"Firstly it's an expensive entrance fee at 30 dollars each. We had a personal guide organised by our driver but somehow a ""helper"" latched on to us and we couldn't get rid of this extra person who insisted on helping us walk up stairs even when repeatedly saying no he just kept following us. At the end the guide demanded 35 dollars for this helper and it was clear that it was a racket and even though our driver had said the guide would be 2500 rupees for the 1.5 hour guide he demanded 5000. This all ended in a difficult argument between us, the driver and the guide. Very disappointed at this behaviour and can't recommend this attraction because of this as it ruined our experience. If you do go then I would advise you say no to any help or guide and insist they leave before commencing on your walk. Beware it is very steep in places with a lot of stairs and as it's very hot and humid take a good quantity of water and sunscreen...."
"A long ascent requiring good shoes and a couple of hours, climbing Lion Rock to the citadel that sits upon it is a must do on a trip to Sri Lanka. Guides are available and knowledgeable or you can do it freelance - either way the achievement that the Rock represents is impressive and the views from the top stunning."
"This place is something else. The first section of the walk goes straight to the ticket office, where foreigners are charged in USD (but you can pay in rupee) and quite rightly pay a whole lot more than locals. There is then a delightful walk towards the rock, we looked straight down at an alligator swimming in the pond, great sighting. The walk turns into a climb up steep steps. You are surrounded by ancient brickwork covered in moss. The giant boulders are covered in ancient step chipped away. It is truly fascinating. Next comes a spiral staircase to take you high onto a ledge with some stunning frescos. Next is the mirror wall, where the ancients have defaced with graffiti, strange how yesterdays vandalism becomes todays priceless history. Banksy?? Onwards and upwards. There is a Red Cross station and rest area before the final staircase to the summit. Beware of the monkeys, do NOT leave any bags unattended. They figure zippers. One stole my suncream and climbed a tree. Fortunately a well aimed pebble dislodged the booty and my sun lotion was returned. We then ascended to the spectacular summit. Take suncream and take water, there are no refreshments available en route. And do visit the museum first. Alas at the end you have to exit via the giftshop, a collection of vendors the hassle you endlessly. Do not visit Sri Lanka without coming here."
"This is a brilliant experience and if you are only going to choose 1 thing to do in the cultural triangle, this is the best.... but be prepared for lack of value for money. Other sights in the world are exceptional for this price, I have no idea what they do with the money generated from this site, but it certainly is not going back into improving it. "
"I really want to be positive and re-instate what others are saying about this place - yes it is fascinating with interesting history and stunning views from both the bottom and the top, but I have to give honest feedback here:"
Such a beautiful site to visit. Absolutely amazing. Better to start in the morning early as possible. Lots of steps and challenging climb but it is safe. There were nice historical cave painting on the way of the journey. In the middle of the journey there is a flat space where you can rest. On the top it is an amazing view and history of a ancient garden and palace. Must visit.
"Crowded and very touristy. People selling things on the way in and the way out. It is a neat hike up the staircases but the rock next to it is better, less crowded and costs $3."
"This was the best natural feature seen on our Sri Lankar tour . Amazing , inspiring , unbelievable . Our driver said this was Sri Lankars 8th wonder of the world ."
It takes you back in the history and makes you feel how did they make it and how did they have all the facilities up there which was actually inaccessible those days.
"Stunning when viewed from the ground, and amazing views at the top. The climb isn't too tricky (although those suffering from vertigo could find it hairy!) - don't be put off - this is a must-do. Make sure you go early to avoid crowds and the humidity/heat of later in the day. Once done, head to Pidurangala Rock nearby, another must-do."

"You have got to go to Sigiriya, and if you do, climb to the top early in the morning or at sunset. It gets very busy/humid during the day."
Go early! This is not a trip to undertake in the heat of the afternoon . Wear sensible shoes and take water . This is a fascinating historical site that rises out of the flattish surrounding countryside. It is easy to see why the King who had his palace built at the top had the rock painted white to give the illusion of his palace floating on a cloud. The rock is approached first through what was a water garden and then a boulder garden. These were also once part of the defensive system. The steps that started in the boulder garden bothered our group of 4 slightly because they seemed narrow and some were sloping and had a gravelly surface. Do not worry - you do not come back down this way! 
It's a long way up but a must do if your in this area. On top there are ruins of an old civilisation that dissapeared long ago
Definitely worth a visit...it's quite a climb & steep in certain areas...lot of little nooks & crannies worth looking at ...the views are beautiful..
"it's a fascinating place but unfortunately very ""touristic"" and I can imagine in the main season way to full of people. And for a price of 30 $ I was expecting a bid more information around the place - without having to get a local guide. The view from the top is breathtaking ... and to imagine how it must have looked like centuries ago ... fantastic"
"We went up about 9.00am - reasonably hot and busy but definitely manageable - lots of photo stops. The history is fascinating (we had our tour guide with us), the views from the top are stunning and the gardens and view looking up equally impressive. Well worth it."
"It's the lion fortress this time... Great timing as we saw the water fountains, which only active during the rainy season.
Glad we climbed."
"It was quite an amazing experience to climb the heritage rock.
The place was well maintained and the people were so helpful. Its quite nice to get the feeling once u reach the top.."
"I have come back after decades, always remembered the place as having been something special... and visiting it again, i was even more impressed... from the layout, as it was built with the natural setup, to the girls in the clouds and the top of the rock..., Sigirya is an impressive experience !"
"First time to Sri lanka and heard good stories about this location and the views. Definitely did not disappoint one bit. 30$ for foreign tourists, but the views at the top are amazing. "
"Quite expensive tickets (compared to other activities at Sri Lanka), but a very nice trip - all the way from the bottom and the old water gardens to the top of the rock. The mirror wall and the old wall paintings were nice, but for us the view and the reuins of the ancient palace at the top were the best. Lots of monkeys, but they were not aggressive. If you are afraid of heights, you are in for a real challenge, but it is worth it."
I spent sleepless night prior to climbing as wasn’t sure if I could do as I am scared of heights and not fit. Got there and was pouring rain with waterfalls on all the stairs going up. We had guide to take us up and he was wonderful and encouraged me all the way to the top! You can stop at Lion’s foot as last part steepest but I am so glad I kept going. Was not that scary and just take a couple of stops on way up. If hot weather go early. I would definitely do it again.
"This is an incredible place. It is a ruin, but the location is like a fairy tale. It is a magnificent spot. It is out of the way, not near the rail and with not much else to see in the immediate area, but worth a day. "
"I would suggest to do a quick read up about the history of the place just like any other tourist attraction with historical significance. It's amazing how more than thousands of years ago humans would have build these structures at such a height without any modern lifting equipment. Try to avoid the scorching afternoon sun and carry water, small towel and wear light comfortable clothes. I bought some mystery boxes made by local artisans, which were being sold by many vendors on and around the lion rock, negotiate for a good bargain. There's no plumbing on the rock so use the washroom on the ground before climbing up."
Recommend people to visit this amazing place. It is quite touristy but the sights and beauty of the place made the visit a memorable one. Make sure you go their early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid the scorching sun. Took us about 2 hrs to climb up which includes a lot of stops for photos. Tip: make sure you bring your drinks with you.
Stunning view from the top to see the greenery. Hiking up and walking up the stairs can be a little challenging for families.  Watch out for unpredictable weather we were drenched in crazy downpour but had a lot of fun
It's a geological wonder visible from far. Many people make it to the Lion's paw but to climb the vertical wall is areal challenge physically and mentally.
Great place to visit. Decent climb required to get to the top with 1202 steps to negotiate. Hard work in the heat and humidity but views at the top well worth it. Take water with you on the climb.
Sigiriya or Sinhmagiri is an ancient rock fortress located near dambulla in Central Province of Srilanka.This is a massive column of rock constructed in a shape of a lion in 8th century BC in a rocky plateau 387 tall from sea level. Now only the lower body lion is survived and upper body already destroyed. This rock palace built by King Kashyap was later converted into Buddhist monastery .
This was an excellent visit well worth the crowds and the climb to the top gave excellent views. Guides will accost you but there is no need for one.
"Beautiful and amazing place with so many things to explore. My personal view, one day is not sufficient to see the true mighty of this wonder !!! For the locals, getting to the rock is as difficult as climbing the rock !!! Foreign visitors have easy entry and exit points."
"Should be on your list of things to do. It had just finished raining and there was still cloud cover so weren't affected by the temperature. If it's sunny then go early and take water and a sun shade. If you don't like heights the stairs can be a bit off putting as there are people coming down, however the hand rails are solid and looking at the next step will get you to the top, which is worth it for the views."
If your in this area the Citadel of Sigiriya is a must visit. How this was built 1500 years ago defies belief. You must have a reasonable head for heights and a fair level of fitness but well worth the effort. Be aware that if you accept a hand from the locals to help you climb the numerous steps (1200 i believe ) they expect to be payed 20 US dollars.
Pictures and words cannot describe this stunning place. UNESCO protected 
"Visited here on a very hot and humid day and have to admit it was too much for us, we made it to the mirror wall, but the sight of the caged winding staircases made us admit defeat. Congratulations the two guys we met coming down in full cricket gear, bats as well!! We enjoyed our visit as what we saw was worth the climb that we did. Many thanks to our guide from Antiquity travel who made sure I was in safe hands coming down all the steps."
"One of the best things we did in Sri Lanka. It's a decent climb but well worth it for the amazing views and interesting climb. Take plenty of water. It cost us USD30 each, so it's not cheap."
Our local guide provided us with in depth knowledge about the King's reign and irrigation planning for Sri Lanka
Our guide gave us amazing insight into the King's irrigation planning for Sri Lanka and the origins of this monument and surrounds.
"An absolutely amazing site, well worth the climb - which is not as strenuous as is might look. Do go early though- try to arrive just before the site opens (at 7am, in high season I think earlier) in order to be one of the first to go up and because it can get too hot later on in the day. It is almost impossible to overtake people going up in front of you so once it gets busy, you can get stuck for quite a while - we have heard that in summer, it took people up to three hours to get up to the top. Take time to enjoy the water and boulder garden before going up as the way down will take you on a different route, to I think the west gate."
"Sigiriya rock is the most popular hike in Sri Lanka. The entry for SAARC nationals is $15 and rest of the foreigners it's $25. The hike itself is pretty easy. Make sure you read the boards along the sites , they talk about some fascinating facts about the marvels of sigiriya."
The ancient citadel of Sigiriya or Lion's Rock as it's referred too was spectacular- no pictures can do it justice.
"This visit was a highlight of our trip to Sri Lanka - a must do. The climb was challenging and I am not great with heights but I was determined to make it to the top with my family. It is an amazing experience, a bit scary in places on the upper levels on the metal steps. My husband and I are in our 50s and managed fine but didn't look down during some of the more challenging elements of the steep climb. Our teenage daughters scampered up and had no problems or fear at all. I am surprised by reviews that don't recommend going to the top and moan about the prices. This is a world heritage site that is historic, ancient and quite simply unique - why would you not pay the small fee to go to the top once there? To go to the top of the Eiffel Tower is approx $75. These sites need to be maintained and tourists do need to give a little back. Yes tipping is de regueur but a little goes a long way. Going out in Sri Lanka make sure you have lots of cash in small notes. While lots of places take cards, most still prefer cash. I didn't know the actual price of the entry ticket as we organised a guided tour from our hotel so we were fortunate to have both a driver and a guide and it was well worth the extra paid as it made for a seamless visit. We learned about the history of the rock and the surrounding gardens from our guide and our guide stayed with us all the way up. It was obvious that the guide (and other guides we encountered) are very proud of their country and rightly so. It is an exhilarating feeling to make it to the top of the rock after a challenging and slightly scary climb but definitely worth it as the views are stunning. There are a lot of wild monkeys around the site and on the upper platform and they love to swing around the steps of the upper levels which made the experience all the more uniquely challenging but overall a brilliant interactive experience. We loved it. We wend mid-morning on a weekday and it really wasn't that busy. If you go to Sri Lanka, don't miss out on this."
"Go early in the morning, first thing if you can as the crowds roll in around 9-9:30am. It was very humid, bring water. 360 views at the top!"
"Lion Rock, Sigiriya features on many travel ads for Sri Lanka. This is a must visit. A good level of fitness is required as it is a climb all the way to the top but worth it for the views all around - if you can't make the top try and go to the Lion's Claws along the Mirror Wall. Drink lots of water and take it steady. Enjoy!"
The rock itself is impressive from a distance but that's all. The climb to view the paintings is hard work and hot. Wear sturdy shoes as the steps/ground are very uneven and you need to watch your step all the way. Don't attempt the climb if you have even the slightest fear of heights - there is an iron staircase and walkway exposed on one side which no doubt is safe but in a crowd is very unnerving. I was concentrating so much on my footing during the climb that nearly missed the paintings! Really not worth the effort/strain in the heat as you are not allowed to take photos and they are all printed in the guide books. Didn't bother continuing to the top so a waste of money for me.
"The frescos are nice - you do get herded through a bit. The views up the top are nice too and you have more room there. But just not worth the price for us - I think 20-25USD would be fair, but it does feel a lot like being exploited for being a foreigner, which detracted from it for me. "
"Be there when it opens to beat the heat and the crowds - avoid weekends for the crowds also. It's severely overpriced and that detracted from the experience for me - 20USD would be more reasonable. The museum had some interesting notes about the site and is worth a visit. We preferred the Pidurangala Rock. More fun scrambling up with locals, great views and waaaay cheaper. "
"I thought Sigiriya seemed expensive at first, so I climbed Piturangala in the morning. I decided to pay to see Sigiriya as well, and I’m glad I did! Many steps, but easy to climb (if you don’t suffer from vertigo) and it was amazing to see the frescos on the wall and gardens and pools on top of the rock. The water garden and ancient irrigation systems makes you imagine how it must have been to live there in its glory days. Worth the money!"
the place is perfectly  preserved also in the green area around the rock. the  climbing experience is strong.
"Did this as a part of a group tour Sept. Guide insisted we go later in the afternoon to avoid the crowd and (supposedly) the heat. It was very hot, so not sure if this was wise. Perhaps since we're regular gym goers we're a little fitter than others our age (60's), husband plays regular tennis, I'd did lots of work on the step climber at the gym prior to going but we both found the humidity was a killer. Made it to the top (unaided), however suffered a heat rash that lasted over a week, wouldn't have done it at all had I realised there are large wasp nests up there (I'm allergic to bee stings, think wasps will effect me as well). My husband's not great with heights, I had to convince him that going back down when we got to the spiral staircases that hang off the side of the cliff was not an option. It's not easy to change your mind when you get to that point. There's a first aid station (large, purpose built about 2/3rds the way up), fair guess they've had big problems sometimes? Falls are easy, keep your eyes down there are many trip hazards, the steps are very uneven (like The Great wall), some are narrow, others wide, some easy and secure others loose. The view at the top is amazing (as the other reviews have already portrayed), reconsider if you're very overweight,suffer from heart issues, heavy smoker, pregnant or have a major health condition. It's not worth dying for a view. Some people were pushed up to the top by locals (people who make a living out of aiding the unfit to get to the top) but is it worth it? Personally, I'd rather take pics from below than get to the top at the risk of my health. Please see photos attached that you could expect to see from the top and make up your mind. At least take water, a hat, good shoes for climbing (even a walking stick),use sunscreen, mosquito repellent etc. plenty of people to sell you things at the bottom"
This is defiantly a must see and do in Sri Lanka. The views from the top are incredible so don’t give up and make sure you make it to the top.
"A very strenuous climb but well worth it. Once you get to the top it is incredible the view is beautiful and the pool just blew me away. Our driver explained the story of the rock and said there was a pool at the top I as blown away at the size and just the fact that it was built on the top of this huge rock. We climbed on a Sunday so it was really crowded, it took ages to get up as there were so many elderly people which were incredible to even attempt the climb and lots of mums carrying their children. One of the highlights of Sri Lanka for me."
"A lovely morning spent at lions rock, the rock and views are beautiful. "
"We had not planned to climb the rock but to see the extensive surroundings and learn about the history of this place. Just as well because the heavens opened just after we arrived, and the climb would have been extra treacherous! We had a nice guide ( who of course needed a tip even though he was paid by our tour company), and he did his best to protect us in the wet slippery conditions, but we just had to cut short our visit. The cost is very high but hopefully the money goes towards further restoration and research."
"The Lion Rock is so worth seeing, its a fair climb to the top. You can just go to the paws or all the way about 1500 steps. Historically unbeatable. I loved every part of Sri Lanka, its like India but clean and not as crowded"
Sigiriya is an impressive rock palace surrounding countryside. The gardens and expensive views of the surrounding countryside.the UNESCO World heritage site of sigiriya.a most singular geological formation towering 660ft above the surrounding plains.
"This is an excellent, well maintained and interesting site. The walkways, steps and handrails are in good condition, so you feel safe even when scaling the side of the rockface!"
This fort is one of the world famous place. You can have nice experience there. This was named as 8th wonder of the world because still couldn't find the technology how they got water up to that rock from the river. 
Historically most important place in sri Lanka. Named as world heritage. Every traveller must visit this
"Worth every step of the climb. Breathtaking view from the top and interesting ruins at the top. Interesting points all along the way, definitely a highlight of Sri Lanka."
"We have two young(ish) children and didn’t fancy spending $30 each to climb the rock and enter the main grounds. Instead, we took a tuk tuk from the entrance around the perimeter. The driver showed us some fab photo spots and we asked him to stop in the village so we could meet the locals and buy some elephant pants for the girls. He was very knowledgeable and it was money well spent, especially when we saw the neverending queue of visitors slowly climbing the stairs up the rock!"
Discount for the sarcastic country pass
Sigiriya is one of those places that you must tick off your bucket list when visiting Sri Lanka.
"It is stunning and unbelievable that the site is on the top of the rock. There is even a pool! One should climb up to the top if physically able to, watch the step especially when it is raining. The view at the top is beautiful and feeling of being on the top of this heritage site is refreshing and satisfactory. Again, going with a guide will let you appreciate the history better."
I wasn't able to go up the rock due to mobility issues but while my husband went up I got a tuk tuk around the base of the rock and it was stunning.
"A foreigner pays Rs. 5000 while a Sri Lankan citizen pays Rs. 50 for the same experience.

Don't get me wrong, it is a great adventure. But not for that price"
"This is a must visit place and the only place we visited in the Srilanka’s cultural triangle . There are in total 1202 steps to climb this citadel . It has an amazing history behind it , which gives a clear picture about how mankind was centuries ago."
Must visit as it is a historic place in Sri Lanka. Good Photos you can take. Rock climbing we did not do. But enjoyed overall
"Interesting, informative, good geology and special history. If you are going to climb the Rock, would suggest very early in the morning to avoid the heat of the day."
This was a fabulous experience from start to end. I myself found it really hard climbing the steps of which there are over a 1000. Sadly I couldn’t make it to the top but nearly well in fact to the lions feet’s area. My husband and our guide went to the top and he said it was such an experience. There are many people to guide you up the steps but beware you must be prepared to tip them. We saw much wildlife there to including a crocodile on the lake and plenty of monkeys. Definitely worth a visit. Ensure you wear a hat and good shoes.
Two weeks ago I had a chance to climb the Sigiriya Citadel. There are many who feel that it should be declared the 8th wonder of the world - I agree.
"This is a pleasant 2-3 hour walk, climbing much of the elevation on steps but these are of very varying pitch; care is needed. The site gets very busy early, so best to go up as early as possible; by 10 many hundreds of people are on their way up, slowly! However, this is a climb well worth making, and really not difficult. "
"Easy choice, pay the cash and climb up or sit in a restaurant in town and see from there. Get there at 7am when the ticket office opens and avoid the tour busses. You do not want to walk up here behind a crowd of people begging for mercy half way up! It isn't that hard but being stuck behind people in the midday heat would not be fun! We arrived at the ticket office just after 7am and scampered past a couple of groups through the gardens. There were maybe 5 people at the top when we got there. Great views, enjoy"
"This was an amazing piece of Sri Lankan history. The day my mother & I went was unfortunately a public holiday so there were thousands of Singhalese on a pilgrimage to the sacred site. It took hours to read the, lions' claws! Well worth the time & effort. "
"It's 1200 steps upwards and some quite steep, so be wary. The stairs are also narrow and isn't anywhere to stop and sit easily. Do this early or later , we really struggled with the climb at midday . The views are spectacular and is really a must see in Sri Lanka"
This is a must visit place in Sri Lanka. All four of us managed to reach the top. It is unbelievable to think that this structures were built 16 centuries ago. Surely this is a world heritage site.
"This is an absolute must see and do. But not for the unfit..cost for a family of 5 entry was 18000 Sri lankan rupees, a guide was another 2000 but really worth the explanation of all the historic boulders and sites. There are 1200 steps up to climb..some quite steep..and 800 steps down. The views of the top are truly spectacular with all the palace grounds and water wells and terraced /rock/water gardens to view on the way. It was the highlight of the trip and while we were quite fit, many found it very difficult climbing to the top as the steps were steep and difficult to stop and sit. They call it the 8th wonder of the world. Couldn't agree more"
"A must if you are in Sri Lanka and well worth the effort of the climb, no need to rush as there is so much to see and soak in. Great amount of history so make sure you get a guide."
"It's quiet expensive but it's nice to walk up, see everything and it's a stunning view from the top.
 I would recommend to go  in the late  afternoon so you have better light for the pictures ;)"
We went to see Citadel of Sigiriya on 7th October 2018. It was raining on that day. Still we managed to climb 1200 steps and reach the top. My wife and I are in our 70s but did not feel that we climbed 1200 steps. Our grand-daughter 6 years old also climbed easily. The view from top was really fantastic. The climb on spiral ladder with rain pouring on us and wind trying to blow away our umbrella was really an experience we don't forget in our lifetime. The fresco's are worth seeing. One wonders how people do these paintings at such a height.
"It was a hot and steamy day, and I am getting on in years so only made it part of the way to the spiral ladder and fresco's. What was more on my mind was 'where does the helicopter land to evacuate me if my heart should give in'"
"awesome architecture in a small space, windy nature, rich in nature and has taken the maximum usage of the nature"
Very beautiful and rich of wonders. Very green and has a lot of history behind it. it is just next to the famous Sigiriya rock so you must do them both
It might look high and hard to do but believe me it worth. It is not very hard to reach up anyway and it is well facilitated and clean. Locals claim that the water up in a small lake is coming from nowhere like it should be one of the world wonders. Try to interact with locals and listen to their stories about the rock.
"Fantastic. A must do. My husband and I are in our 60s and we managed it, albeit quite slowly. It is reasonably priced. Climb early in the morning to avoid the heat and the bulk of the tourists."
I cannot understand why this top place in Sri Lanka is not accepting any credit cards at the ticket counter for foreigners! 
"Sigiriya is stunning. There's a small museum, of minor interest, by the car park, and then a walk through parkland, with lakes and gardens. It's probably about 10 minutes' walk to the base of the rock. Get used to steps: there are loads, and it's quite a climb. It's not impossible, but you certainly know about it. And be warned: some of the steps are metalwork pinned to the vertical side of the rock. If (like me) heights bother you, they are guaranteed to get to you. But, whatever you do, go to the top. It's absolutely stunning: right up with the very loveliest places I've been to."
"We highly recommend climbing Lion Rock! However, it is not for the faint of heart. I generally do not have problems with heights but this one was a little scary. There are two metal, spiral staircases (one up and one down) to see the preserved paintings on the side of the rock. My legs got a little shaky on those! Then there are many stairs up to the rock itself, these are stone and not too bad. The stairs up to the top of the rock are metal and fastened to the side of the rock. They were very sturdy but if you have a fear of heights, this part might bother you. There isn't much shade at the top but the views are amazing! Don't forget to bring water. There is a first aid station at the bottom of the rock in case you aren't feeling well after (or before, I suppose) your climb."
We traveled around Sri Lanka within 9 days with Asya Tours. One of the most famous tourist attraction in Sri lanka. The 1200 steps climb to the top was well worth it. Our wonderful guide from Asya Tours Kamal has extensive knowledge of Sri Lankan history and culture and we were privileged to learn lot from him about the fascinating history and culture of Sri Lanka. The view at the top is spectacular
"Quite expensive but the entry fee is paying for staff, maintenance and restoration of a heritage site."
this lion rock is very ancient place to visit.after we climb the top of the mountain we can see most beautiful scene.total green. but we have to be little bit careful about wasp is over there.and some notice board also have there keep silent.but we didn't heard that anyone got hurt from them.
"There is nothing much left of anything and what is left are the angled curbs and steps of what it once was. The climb to the top is quite manageble but full of hazards, need to be quite careful although the local kids go bare foot. USD30 entrance fee for tourists. "
"We head it early to the Sigiriya Rock, to pass the crowd, if you are a group always pay in group."
"We head it early to the Sigiriya Rock, to pass the crowd, if you are a group always pay in group."
its a good climb to the top and certainly not one for any one suffering from heights...  the view from the top is amazing.  Take  a local guide as the history behind the rock is fascinating.
"Good place vsit. Climb the lion rock.Not a very tough climb, if you go slowly.Ticket price is very high . There are similar climbs and historic places in india which does not cost so much.So foreigners ,particularly those who are not from SAARC countries have to pay too much like $30 for a ticket.So probably not worth for that price."
"You can easily climb the Rock.Just go little slow.Do not take guides.There is nothing much to explain.There are lot of stories about this place.No specific historic conclusions on it. Guides will tell you some cooked up stories.So don't entertain them 
Enjoy the climb"
One of those tourist sites where the number of participants can dictate your enjoyment.
Very interesting place to visit.
"Go for the opening - 7am, less hot and less crowded. Wouldn’t have liked to go when it was crowded as its a long climb up the rock and on some fixed metal staircases as well"
The ancient rock city is entered through one of the ancient landscaped gardens which includes watering systems. From here the lion rock can be viewed in all its majesty. The climb to the top is equal to 70 steps and its done in three sets of stairs. Unfortunately there are no lifts and it requires some physical fitness. In the end its worth the effort. Best time to climb is early mornings at 7 am. 
"Let's be honest, this is not the easiest attraction for travelers from northern Europe or the US as it is hot and humid. My face was red as a beet when I returned to the parking lot and my t-shirt soaked with sweat after 2 hours. Now that I scared you, you don't want to miss the climb to the top. The frescoes are beautiful (half way up), and the palace on the top interesting, but not as wonderful as the breeze that flows over the top. The view over the jungle is breathtakingly beautiful. Come early in the morning when it is still cooler and bring water. Bring good closed shoes for hiking. Some steps are sharp and ruined my sandals."
"This is what we went to Sigirya for and it didn't disappoint. The climb to the top is arduous and if you plan to climb, get there early morning and avoid times =when it's raining. The steps can be slippery. We hired a Guide. They are both knowledgeable and help with the climb too. The views are amazing and there is no apparent urgency to get to the top. Guides do help and are very informative about the Rock and areas round it. Well worth a visit and take in the garden area on the approach."
"We climbed late in the afternoon. Good choice, as it was bit cooler. We both are well over 60 and i was not sure if i could do it. It was very windy, that made the climb even more scary. You are best to keep your eyes down to see where you step. STOP when you want to look around. There is so much to see and it's all amazing! I cannot comprehend how all the steps and artwork was done over 1600 years ago!"
A must see place when in the area. A lot of history and interesting ruins. You need a couple of hours to see all of this site. Lots of monkeys throughout the area. Some people hits bikes to ride around the ruins
"A long strenuous walk with many steps but well worth the effort to make it to the top. About 1200 odd steps of varying steepness but great views from the top, takes about 45mins to go up."
"This is a beautiful place to visit. Lots of history. It is $15 for members of SAarc countries and $30 for others. Important to bring passports to avail the $15 rate. Regional manager major nishanta was very accommodating of our family with little children. The tone of his leadership set the tone for the rest of the people working there. The client is steep so wear comfortable clothes. If you can make it to the top, you will be blessed with a mind blowing views. Even if you can make it to the lines pause, there is a lot of history you will pass. It is pretty taking to imagine that 1600 years ago, this country had such engineering prowes.. I would recommend to take a guide. We used HArshad who was quite knowledgeable and improved our experience of the place.."
"The climb up to Lion Rock was pretty hard, but the view we were rewarded with was amazing. 

It’s best to go up as early as possible to avoid the crowds. We went up at around 7am."
Lion Rock was on the itinerary of an amazing ten day tour that we took with Select Tour Sri Lanka. 
"This is well worth a visit. A world heritage site Our trip started by walking through the water gardens leading to the rock , don’t miss this anticipating what is to come! You have to work out a bit to get to the top but there are place to stop and take in the view. Go early so it’s not too hot for climbing the views from the top are spectacular and it’s worth contemplating how they built such an amazing palace up there .well worth a visit wear well fitting shoes to be safe on the steps "
"Start very early, take your time and enjoy the views as you ascend to make it an easy half day out. Getting to the top is well worth it so don't hurry."
Make sure you go early or late to avoid the heat of the day. Cash e try 30 USD is required per adult to enter. ATM is nearby but best to take enough cash.
"My experience with Sigiriya Lions Rock was exceptional.. It must be 8th wonder of the world , architecture and ancient technology was amazing .. Whoever traveling to Sri Lanka you must visit this excellent place just 150 kilometers from the Bandaranaike International Airport..
Thanks"
Tour with a nice family fron england nice two kids and a very kind sir and madom they were with me traveling for 5 day around srilanka
"This is a key element of any cultural tour of Sri Lanka. It looks stunning from a distance and though best to come early, the best photos are in the pm when the sun has risen (they are also the ones used in the promotional literature). The trick is visit the site then take the distance shots afterwards."
"So I would really recommend you go with a guide and first thing in the morning to avoid the heat and the crowds. Our guide was able to help us cheat a queue here and there, fill us in on the history, point out the land lizards bopping around and also knew the best places for photos. "
"We visited here whilst on holiday from UK. Cost was circa 3,800 rupees which was a bit more expensive than I thought it would be. They have 3 lines for you to pay, 1) locals, 2) if you're paying with USD, 3) foreign tourists paying with Sri Lankan Rupees."
"You need to earn this! It's a sustained trek to the top, with multiple flights of stairs, some actually cut in to the rock. However, it is undoubtedly worth the effort. The history, the ruins and the views of the surrounding countryside are phenomenal. A lot of people make this trip so well worth getting there early in the day."
Sigiriya.( Lion Rock )...................
1200 plus stairs. Tick the box. Maybe I am a bit jaded a view of trees from ruins. They have done well archeologically as on the entrance one side is excavated the other is as found (almost) the climb can be a personal for some 
In front of castle you can be proud like as a lion.uf you are on the top of that catsle you can see very beautiful view arround you.
That is a very amazing place in sri lanka with very talented architectural and very creative prescos also there.
"Loved Sigiriya temple rock - palace built by King Kasyapa 470ish AD, devious son of King Dhatusena, and half brother of Crown Prince Moggallana. So K, killed his dad, D, and banished his brother, M, built the palace, then like any good storyline, M makes a comeback from exile, to overthrow K. K kills himself! By his own aword on the battle field! Wow - and not a hollywood scout insight!"
"Great climb, amazing spiral staircase to the cave paintings. Absolutely amazed that tourists ignore the no photograph signs and then blatantly say see they did not see them- very disrespectful and then claim ignorance when it says you will be fined for taking photos."
"A challenging climb to the Top. My favourite Heritage Site. The Water Fountains at the Pleasure Gardens still work during the monsoon period when there is heavy rain. The 5th Cent. Frescoes, The Mirror Wall and the Lion entrance boggles the mind of every visitor to this truly remarkable piece of architecture."
This was an exhilarating experience but well worth it. The climb itself was quite difficult in parts and there are many tourists. However the view from the top was certainly worth it. Make sure you allow yourself plenty of time to do it.
The view at the top makes the climb worthwhile.  It's a scary ascent up the spiral staircase to the frescoes but they are also worth the trip.  Fascinating history and ruins.  A highlight of our Sri Lankan trip.
Very nice water gardens at the bottom. Climb up is long and stairs are slippery in some areas .
This is a definite must see when in Sri Lanka. You'll be amazed by the history and story behind the place. Not to mention how stunning it is.
Recently visited Sigirya. It was a great experience and fabulous to learn about Sri Lankan history dating back centuries. Was shocked by the price of entry sitting at $41USD per person but more so by the shonky USD to rupee conversion which occurred at the ticket counter. Not a great way to promote tourism.
Very hot but worth the long drive and heat
Definitely don't miss this incredible architectural wonder. Pay for a guide so you get the full historical story behind this incredible achievement. The walk is not as difficult as I had feared especially if you take it slowly. Well worth the effort.
"I am expecting a bigger structure, the paw wasn’t amazing as expected. The climb wasn’t too harsh I think. The view on the summit is worth a climb!"
"We came here a few weeks ago on our first morning in Sri Lanka. We read all the advice about going at 7am, but we didn’t arrive at our hotel until 10pm the night before, after travelling for 30 hours, so we had a bit of a lie in and went at 11.30am. It was also a local bank holiday."
Some amazing views from the top! A fairly hard climb not for  the faint hearted!  Wall murals excellent - no photography. Glad we did it!
"Sigiriya - Lion Rock is one of the major tourist attraction of Srilanka which is located about 18 Kms from Dambulla town. You travel towards Trincomalee from Colombo / Kandy and after 10 kms, from Dambulla, you take a road on the right to Sigiriya Lion rock which is about 8 kms from that point. There will be sign boards indicating the direction. "
One of the most talked about things to see and do in Sri Lanka... and now I know why.
1200 or steps with railing is a lot better than some places where you climb over steep boulders and uneven steps. The moment you are on your way up to the rock you are hit with a barrage of touts wanting to help you up the stairs. They are not guides as some reviewers say. Just be polite and keep looking straight ahead and say no thank you. No need to be rude. I usually help my wife on climbs but in this instance I struck a deal with one of them and for 2000 rupees it was well worth it. Less stress on both of us and he knew how to hold her and help her up and down. So if you really want to climb Lion rock and feel this is helpful it really doesn't cost much in the great scheme of things. They know their targets which are older people. Enjoy the climb and the rock art.
Visiting this was well worth the payment. Amazing views. Great history. Plenty to see on the way up and down. Monkeys and beautiful grounds to picnic in. Take a hat as the sun is very hot and plenty of sunscreen.
"I am so glad we made the effort to get up to Sigiriya to see the world heritage sight and Lion Rock. You are best to get a guided tour because this way you will learn about the history of the area. It really is a sight to behold, the ingenuity of people living over 2000 years ago now! "
I recommend going there if you ever visit Sri Lanka. This is an amazing feat of human ingenuity combined with natural beauty. The hike up to the top might be a bit of an effort for some but the views are amazing. 
Great place to visit but definitely worth going as early as possible to beat the heat and the crowds. Grateful to Lonely Planet for this tip!
"This was so Amazing to see, seared in History, we saw heaps of monkeys, saw a crocodile lazing in the sun in the middle of lake, heaps of frogs at the side of lake, we managed to climb the 1,202steps to the top & what a view saw a gecko on a termite mound having his lunch, saw the sunset from the top & it was spectacular, if you visit Sri Lanka don’t miss Lion Rock."
"Start early, as it's a hot and humid climb. Reasonable fitness is recommended, with appropriate footwear. The climb was not too bad, and the views at the top make up for all the sweating. A light breeze and a little shade was offered at the top. "
It is an Amazing place with a really nice view from the top. Better to start early in the morning to avoid the sun and the crowd.
"It’s a beautiful fortress and a wonder. You should enjoy the garden, around, before you start your climbing. The lakes with pink lotus flowers will remind you the ‘Water Lilies’ by Monet. The climbing is little bit hard but you can do it slowly and enjoy the scenery while you climb. It will be unbelievable to see the remains of a big fortress on the top of this huge rock. It’s a must visit site in Srilanka."
 that is a really amazing place handsome book says that's a 8th wonder of the world really nice Garden and also on top nice view and many things to see specially Fresco mirror wall I really like to introduce this sigiriya lion Rock that's really amazing place
"Well this is the Tick the box item that has to be done if you visit Sri Lanka. Its the Taj Mahal of SL. The climb can be a little tough at times, especially when its hot and the wind is blowing strong. Plus it can also make you feel a little queazy at times, and a bit unsafe..but the view when you get to the top is awesome, and well worth the effort. You won't regret it."
One of the wonders in Asia and Unesco Heritage site. Avoid mid day if you are vising this place due to hot sun.
"1200 steps up so its not for the faint hearted but its well worth the effort! It opens at 7am and I recommend you arrive for it! Not only will you beat the crowds and have a much more peaceful time on the journey and at the top, you will also not have to climb it during the heat of the day!"
The journey to the top is super exhausting due to the high temperature but at the same time worth it when you get the amazing view.
This tourist attraction has a bit of everything; I can't deny the walk up the 1200 steps is a little hair raising as ultimately you feel like you are hanging off the side of the mountain! However certainly for my son this was part of the attraction. My middle daughter who has vertigo did not make it up but my 10 year old did...……
"More than 2500 years old historical place. Still have the evidence for such a technique what sri lankan people have in the past. Better if you can hire a tourist guide for get to know about those information. Feel the environment, dont destroy. Save for the future."
"I never thought my wife and me could climb it, but we did. The rise is steep and dangerous at times, specially for people who are afraid of heights. But we braved all this and climbed to the top. It was late evening and a handful of people were actually on the top. The feeling cannot be described. You can see the entire Sigiriya jungle from the top view. Although while coming back, it was dark and we had very few people for company. It was a little scary but worth it."
"The climb is easy, up around 500 steps. The view from the top is totally worth it. It’s windy of course but the views are breathtaking all around. Get there early as it gets really crowded after 9.30am. Probably takes 30 mins to climb up and then another 30 mins to take in the views. A must-do if you’re in Sri Lanka "
"The ticket cost $ 30.00 including the Lion Rock citadel, the Mirror Wall and the Museum. "
"The 1200 steps climb to the top was well worth it. Our wonderful guide, Ranindu Lakmal Kalubowila has extensive knowledge of Sri Lankan history and culture and we were privileged to learn from him about the fascinating history and culture of the area and see the remnants of bygone eras. A highlight of our Sri Lankan trip. "
As I said this is d most famous tourist attraction in Sri Lanka. However this is very exp USD 30 for each person..
The most famous attraction of Sri Lanka... A 2000+ year old citadel... Unfortunately only ruins are left...
"We doubted we could make the climb, me with Cystic Fibrosis and terrible lungs and my partner with chronic back issues. We paid for a guide which was well worth it except for the fact he scammed us into tipping a ridiculous amount (LKR3000) just for his mate to help her against her wishes!!! Without going into the details as to.how they did it, just remember there are some unscrupulous people here. See photos of guide and unsolicited steroid helper man!! Fortunately this is rare in Sri Lanka from our experience so far!"
"This is a must if you go to Sri Lanka. World heritage with history, view and experience. "
A fantastic experience and well worth the climb. The gardens are lovely and well worth taking the time to explore. The climb is not too strenuous and rewards you with fantastic views from the top. Plenty of places to stop and rest if needed on the way to the top. I would highly recommend going early before the heat and the crowds. A truly rewarding experience.
I had been looking forward to visiting this site and was not disappointed. 
"It’s well worth a visit. You don’t need to be super fit but a decent level of fitness. If you take your time, have decent footwear (we wore trainers), and a big bottle of water, you’ll make it. The views from the top are amazing as are the key sites along the way - the mirror wall, the paintings and the lion paw stairs."
"I was in Kandy in January earlier this year on a visit to Sri Lanka with my friends. I had the opportunity to drive to Sigiriya from Kandy and also visit Dambulla on the way. My 3 friends and I decided to climb right through to the top of Sigiriya rock, even though it was a slightly rainy day and could be a bit slippery, but there was no way I would change my decision. It is definitely not for the faint hearted, but if you are brave enough to experience something new, Sigiriya rock rewards you with incredible rock architecture and one of the best views. The rock used to be a palace for the king, and what a beautiful palace it is! A few things to note: 1) There are wasps and monkeys along the way, so be careful, 2) SAARC member citizens have a different pricing, so carry proof to avail benefit of the pricing different if eligible."
Excellent place to visit in sri lanka.its a very valuble & beautiful place specialy for foreigners..
"I had been to this place with couple of my friends. To begin with entrance fees is around 30 USD for foreigners and SAARC country nationals get 50% discount. The place is crowded and weather was hot. Initial 1 hr we were able to cover only 25% of the total steps due to slow moving heavy crowd, however once we crossed the first level it took us just 20 minutes to reach the top. It is not as tough as it seems, only two things to beware of, fear of heights due to steel steps covering the final acsent to the top and bees, there are lot of bee hives in the rocks. You'll get some good views on top and it's worth an hour of your time. "
Around 1200 steps will have you up on top of the rock where the remains of the Palace from 500ad remain today.
"This was an excellent trip unfortunately we went on a public holiday and it was really really busy. Myself didn't make it too far but my partner went to go to the top with our guide but the queues were just too long ...he did get so far and thoroughly enjoyed it. What I would advise is be wary of the guys who say they are ""tourist helpers"" we asked our guide if they were legit he said yes but at the end of our tour they demanded money...they didn't get what they asked for but we did tip a little as we always do to anyone who helps us, but it put a bit of a dampner on our day, they didn't get nasty but they weren't very pleasant either. "
"I guess it's the high expections, but we were slightly underwelmed. It was a nice activity with good views at the tops, but nothing extraordinary. We did like it. We went really early, and started at 7am. Which is nice and highly recommended. Its a doable climb (mostly stairs with good hand rails) but it tends to get busy, when we were going back at around 8;30 it was already very crowded (and it was low season). Some people suggest to do the Pidurangala rock, which indeed is cheaper, but also more difficult (not always stairs and handrails)"
It is definitely worth an early start to climb the rock before it gets too hot. The history of the citadel is fascinating and the views from the top glorious.
"We climbed Sigiriya Rock with our fantastic guide, Sugath, as part of a 4 day tour. He advised we go at about 4pm as even though it would be warmer than early morning, it would be quiet and we could see the sunset from the top. The walk up is steps all the way, some of which are quite narrow and steep, but doable by any able bodied person who doesn't suffer from fear of heights. The cave paintings are worth the extra climb. The top of the rock is large and fairly flat, with great views. No facilities of any kind, though. We admired the sunset, enjoyed the antics of the wild monkeys and descended easily before it was dark, the last people to leave. A very good visit made immeasurably better by our guide giving us information as we went - if you did it alone, there wasn't much information posted to help with explaining the history - you'd have to research that in advance."
"A long and steep climb of 1200 steps up but it is so worth it - the climb is tough so wear suitable shoes and bring lots of water. Also try go early morning we were there at 6.30am so took the climb at our own pace, the heat was not to much and thorougly enjoyed it. The ruins at the top are full of history and the view is spectacular. If the going gets tough the local people who work then will give you a hand climbing with a broad smile and encouragement. I do not particularly like heights but the view is worth the climb"
"This site is not for the very young, old or unwell. You are climbing and climbing while seeing what humans can build to protect themselves. The walk and climb is up a sheer rock face and will take a couple of hours but when you get to the top wow. You have an amazing structure built on top of a rock, how this was achieved one can only imagine. The best thing is the views 360 degrees of the country for miles. I was so pleased that we made the climb to feel a level of achievement but also to witness one of the many wonders of this country. Well worth the visit but make sure you have comfortable shoes and lots of water. Recommend climbing early in the day to beat the crowds and the heat. "
"Historical place which dates back to 3rd century BC... 477-495 AD this was the fortress of king kasyapa.. master achitectural and with a palace garden, water garden with natural hydrolic system which is still functional during the moonsoon season, and boulder garden.. and beautiful frescos and the mirror wall and at the top the palace.. it takes at least 2 houra to discove the whole area...!! "
So the day that we went there it was pretty darn crowded and we hope we went there another day and then we were wondering why did that happen and it was because that day was a public holiday so I strictly recommend you not to go there on public holidays specially in April and August also in December because those months students get vacations so they go on trips. So I think it’s better to go near sigiriya and talk with some locals from maybe the hotels and get to know a best day.
"I don't know where to start maybe pay for a guide to learn a lot more about the history, but what an amazing place to visit ."
"The views from the top ARE awesome, but don’t underestimate the climb. Over 1,200 stair steps to negotiate. It was busy for us, so there was no hurry. It was easy to take time over the climb. It would be crazy to try and rush. Even for nervous climbers, there are plenty of lacs to hold on - and to let faster people past"
My girls (9 & 12)& us enjoyed this. Be careful to pick your times though as middle of the day is very hot as the rock offers very little shade. You will need a moderate amount of fitness but if you are unfit you could manage albeit quite slowly.
"You can enter this sight at 7am , so we would advise that you do this in order that you avoid the heat the crowds and the wasps, there are a lot of dogs around here even at the top but they won’t bother you unless you get your breakfast out. The climb is quite heart pumping and also if you suffer from vertigo at some points you may struggle but the view is stunning and well worth it. On the way back down you could see the crowds starting to build up so we were glad we avoided them especially the Chinese who tend to talk very loud and this is apparently what gets the wasps going( hope this isn’t classed as racist) of which we didn’t see any "
"We really enjoyed our visit to Sigiriya. I recommend visiting between breakfast & lunch, before the afternoon heat sets in. It would be nice if the site could add extra signage at the entrance because the ticket office is somewhat hidden. A must-visit site in Sigiriya!"
"A must see place for any visitor to Sri Lanka. The 1200 or so steps take some time, but well worth the effort. Have a good guide to give you the history. We started very early, at 7:00 am when it wasn't hot, there was a nice breeze and before the crowds start arriving. So no backlog of people on the stairs. I was back in my hotel having a late breakfast by 10.00 am. "
"Very very expensive. HOWEVER, it is a beautiful place. Gardens beneath are well maintained (gardeners must get most of the income) and the rock is as fantastic as advertised. Its a very hot climb in these tropical conditions so bring a hat, sun screen and water. If your unfit it may take you a few hours to get up."
This was one of my favorite things we did in Sri Lanka. It’s truly amazing to see what kind of detail this was built with so many years ago. Such a magical place.
"We did a day trip from Kandy which was a lovely drive (ignoring the crazy busses). The lion rock is awesome in natural and historic, man made beauty and wonder. Not cheap mind you but worth it, the walk up includes many ancient ruins and drawings. The view is amazing. Oh...watch out for bees! "
"The ticket office opens at 0700, therefore you can’t do sunrise on this rock. The tickets cost $35USD per person for tourists. (for some reason, you’ll come across lots of prices being quoted in USD and I can’t remember what I paid in LKR :/). I would recommend walking at around opening time as there are less people walking at this time and it’s not overly sunny. We also found that lots of people were arriving as we were finishing up. As you enter, there’s lovely water gardens and a moat. The walk is sealed and only steps. No uneven ground or loose gravel however there is quite a number of stairs and can be steep at times. Some of the stairs are awkward if you have a longer foot, so be careful of that. Once you get to the top, there’s plenty of space to cover including the original royal pool. There’s a lot of history here. Theres a museum near the ticket office which is a nice stop off at the end before leaving. We had our guide Sangeeth Gayan who told us the story of the old fortress and the history associated with Lion Rock. "
"We were a bit taken aback at the 30 dollars entrance fee but the site is well work a visit. But go early both to avoid the crowds and the worst of the heat. It opens at 7 am so be there at that time. We stayed on a nearby guesthouse and walked over. The wall paintings are beautiful and one of the attendents pointed out the mistakes to us -3 hands, 3 nipples. The climb is reasonably strenuous but if you go early, you will have some shade. The views on top are magnificent and although there is no shade apart from a couple of trees, there was a strong cooling breeze. All in all, stunning!"
Must do climb early in the morning amazing history to be learnt and views are fantastic fairly easy climb
Worth visiting for sure and paying for a guide to explain everything too. Really enjoyable morning out. Highly recommend going early morning when it’s cool and not doing if you don’t like heights.
Stunning location.
This is the most beautiful and interesting place my husband and I visited in Sri Lank for our honeymoon. It is beyond breathtaking and is a must do if you visit this wonderful country. 
People who prefer adventure & nature would love this palace... Early morning is the best time for the hiking... A must visit place in Sri Lanka...
"What a place! Stunning is the only word. Just to take in the views is enough, but to stand an appreciate the history of place the is something else. "
"The historical heritage is well preserved, while facilitating with visitors' requirements. The surrounding is well maintained , creating a friendly environment. In weekends the site is exceeding carrying capacity from both domestic and foreign visitors. Visit to Sigiriya site museum is a must, the prehistoric evidences found from the heritage site are exhibited giving a memorable pre trial of Sigiriya visit, Mirror wall, graffity, palace on the summit, exceptionally the Sigiri maidens at the frescopockets will draw your enthusiasm to the past glory of the citadel."
Great site for history lovers. Totally three hours to visit all the ste. Entrance tickets are expensive and the museum entrance are included in the full tickets.
"The place Sigiriya is 5 hrs journey from Colombo. The place charges 30 USD as entry fees, it only the view from top. Rather you can walk a 1kms ahead of Sigiriya and climb the Pidrungula mountain for 2 USD entry fees and get the same view."
"Definitely worth doing, even with $30 per person fee. Go early to avoid the massive crowds and heat of the day. Great views from the top, and crazy to see the huge ancient palace ruins. Lovely grounds too, and an abundance of wildlife. Super easy to get the bus to and from if you're on a budget! Also worth walking through the wildlife belt past all the local stands to see the giant Buddha (just follow the locals instead of going to the tourist car park). No need for a guide either. The walk to Aligaya caves (signposted down from the steps to climb sigiriya) was a bit sketchy, we didn't make it all the way so probably best not to try!!"
One of the most visited destinations or tourist spots in Sri Lanka and absolutely a must see and do.
its a bit of a climb to the top of the rock but well worth it. Amazing views from the top. I would strongly recommend setting off early in the morning as it gets very busy and the queues to climb the steps get quite long. They do have people on the steps to help anyone struggling as well
The rocky outcrop dominates the horizon and is synonymous with Sri Lanka so a must see! But it’s a hard climb to the top and not one for anyone who suffers from vertigo. Take water with you as none available until you return to ground level. Views from the top are just gorgeous and the thought of how the fortress was constructed all those years ago on top of such an inaccessible place is quite hard to comprehend.
"Beautiful gardens with lily ponds and fortress ruins at the entrance, then a tough climb up the hundreds of stairs/ladders to see cave paintings, the lion entrance and ultimately the fortress ruins on top of Lion Rock. A wonderful site - but we were glad we’d gone early to beat the crowds and the heat, and that we had a professional local guide to make the most of the sights."
Fabulous and great place of interest. Access not for the faint hearted but well worth the climb. What a feat of engineering!
"A truly spectacular landmark which will knock your socks off with the views from the top, makes the climb worthwhile. The local people seem to truly value and care for this UNESCO World Heritage Site which is nice to see also. "
"Leave to Sigiriya, a 650 feet high rock fortress in the sky, a masterpiece of
construction, artistry & irrigation. A world Heritage Site (5th Century AD). The world
famous fresco paintings of Heavenly maidens are housed in a cave."
"Sigiriya Rock and gardens is really a lovely place, there is a moat like canal as you enter, then the water gardens that some still hold water but most and the rest of the site are just small remnants of what you could imagine to be an impressive place."
"Such a beautiful palace/citadel , gardens, ponds all reflecting the luxurious life of ancient royalty in SriLanka ."
Yes about 1200 steps . Some steps we’re stepper there others .
Sigiriya is a famous attraction of both local ans foreign tourists.
"What can I say, you don’t go to Egypt without seeing the pyramids..

Just go, you will be fool if you don’t.. enough said"
"A lot of narrow steps (1500) but worth it for the view and interesting history. Very windy up top, wouldn’t recommend it for elderly or young children."
It was a usual crowded weekend and it was cloudy. Make sure to bring a some to cover your self after checking weather forecasts.
"So, I should have been doing this with my wife and three teenage children but ill-health got in the way and there was only me and the old two kids."
"An experience to remember in Sri Lanka it was great, first we went to buy the tickets and as a foreigner it was a little bit expensive (USD 30 per person) compared to other places in Sri Lanka. You can visit the Museum before the rock it’s included."
Going up the rock is a must - despite the 1223 steps which initially sounds v daunting but it is more gradual than an all in one go!
"Loved this place, but more exhilirating than Alton Towers in places. So glad I conquered my fears to climb the spiral staircase to see the amazing paintings. I could not believe they were so old. "
"There are some moments on the way up when you will start to wonder if it is worth the effort. For the views alone, it is. The ruins themselves are basic, and poorly (if at all) labelled. But if you allow your imagination to fill in the blanks and picture how it could have been, it is really something special."
"A place to see,  but your you are fit and able not a place to test yourself
A feeling of well done,  and great feeling of satisfaction"
"This park has many interesting and beautiful areas to see. There are water gardens with lotus flowers, lots of monkeys roaming around, a moat, ancient drawings, a preserved kingdom on top of the rock and beautiful grounds everywhere. The climb was challenging but doable and the view from the top was awesome."
Unmissable. We spent 16 days touring Sri Lanka and without a doubt climbing Lion Rock was one of the most spectacular experiences we had.
"We initially wanted to go to Adam's Peak but that was closed for 3 months, so we decided to do Sigiriya instead. Luckily, we paid local prices. It's still worth it, even at tourist prices as the upkeep of the place must cost quite a bit. "
"Very interesting place and although access/stairs are challenging, pleased we made the effort. Crowded on the day of our visit but people flow is well managed and organised."
"Im a bit afraid of heights but managed the climb. If you really want to make it easy the back way down is a smaller climb up you just miss seeing some paintings.The earlier the better as you don't want to wait on the steps.A guide is a good idea, we had Sanjaya tours but booked him from the airport all the way around, he was fantastic. "
We arrived at the end of the afternoon at Sigiriya and it was fabulous ... the sunset and the sunset at the top of the rock is truly magical! In addition to that the climb is easier with less heat and less tourists!

"Probably the main tourist attraction , lots of people so if you go , do it very early. When we came down about 12 aclock the line of people was from all the way down up to the top, thank god we went early. The tickets cost is 30 dollars and then you walk about a kilometer to get to the rock. 1200 steps up to the top , no problem , but if you dont like high places dont go, the steps are steep and it can be windy. There are few resting point along the way . Once up the view i great , you can see the ocuntry from all the sides of the rock, veru nice. Coming down you will see some monkeys and a buddhist temple. good place to visit for an morning stretch."
"Imagine this structure was built some 1,500 years ago and the infrastructure involved in making the top a working palace for King Kasphyapa was simply mind-blowing."
"Well worth a visit. The museum is interesting as has English commentaries. The view from the top of the rock is beautiful. It was great to hear about the history of the rock from our guide / driver. The climb to the top is not for the faint hearted, on winding and sometimes open stairs attached into the cliff edge. I have only given four stars because the ques to get up were terrible. There was roughly 2 hours of queuing to ascend the rock. "
"The entrance price for foreigners is a lot more than the local people. Take water , start the climb as early as possible otherwise it gets very hot in the midday sun. Recommend you wear trainers it is very steep in some parts. Beautiful paintings inside a cave at the top of the spiral staircase, you don't get enough time to see the paintings as you are ushered on by the guard who sits there. There is a half way point , lions paw but no toilets . You reach the top by a so called staircase , the views are amazing at the top. I thought I could not get to the top but I saw locals who very elderly and mothers with babies climbing. It took us two hours to reach the top , we spent about half an hour at the top. Make sure you rest plenty before you start your downward journey my legs felt like jelly because I hadn't rested enough . The day we went it was totally packed with people pushing and shoving. There is a nice museum at the entrance. "
"Well worth the climb and the early start. We went up to the top first to avoid heat and crowds, and visited the other things like caves and points of interest afterwards (you can access them even once you are directed on the way down to the 'foreigners' car park'). It's actually a smaller area at the top than I expected. I am 54 and of average fitness and I didn't struggle with the steps. Just pace yourself (slow-moving crowd anyway) and take plenty of water. Lots of monkeys added interest for us. We had to wave away someone trying to act as a guide but he gave up pretty easily. Didn't really resent the high $30 fee but I do wish they would do even more to pick up rubbish. It was ok at the top but fairly bad in lower areas before the climb. Didn't feel entirely safe on the staircases - I do wonder how often the structure is properly checked and whether there is ever any limit on the number of people going up and down at any one time. Maybe that's just me! I certainly wouldn't take children younger than 8."
"I'm not going to spoil it for you, but all told, with a thunderstorm threatening to quicken the pulse, I felt I was on an Indiana Jones set! Take water and wear shoes, and be prepared for lots of steps!"
Quite a climb to the top but our young 3-year-old daughter managed to make it to all but the last few steps before needing to be carried as she was so excited about all the interesting things on the way It probably not for those afraid of heights as the walkway is steep and narrow in parts. If you are physically challenged it may be worth paying one of the guides to pull you up or carry your child note that they are very expensive and most of there tour is just written on the self guide signs on the way up. Take plenty of water as it can be quite hot. I would not miss this site if you are in the area.
"Well worth the climb to immerse oneself in the heritage of Sri Lank,was very busy the day we visited so it was a slow climb. The history is very interesting and the view is exceptional. Noticed that all levels of fitness were undertaking the climb."
We were there at 7am and it wasnt too busy at all. Really breathtaking views of beautiful scenery!  Highly recommend!
We went to Sigiriya on the first day of arrival. And was there in the early morning when it was not as crowded. It is about 1200 steps and not for the faint heart. Some of the steps were steep and slippery. It is a tick off the bucket list. Good experience and great pics opp. 
If you look at this place and try to imagine how difficult it would have been to build hundreds of year ago. It is absolutely astounding. The view from the top is outstanding.
Very interesting especially with a guide. Interesting history. Great views.  Rare falcon sited. Not for the unfit!
"Although we didn't know it, our visit coincided with both a Sunday and a Poya day, which meant that the site was absolutely packed and the climb to the top was via a continuous caterpillar of people!"
Our family experience was terrible to put nicely. The staff and security were highly discriminitive forcing foreigners to pay a higher price than locals to climb a rock unsafely without any toilet facilities or first aid. 
Top tip: Get a great guide to tell you the stories and show you the way up and the best way down! Ask at your hotel and they will organise for a guide before you get there and your guide will meet you. We had 'Neil' - I'm sure he had a much nicer Sri Lankan name than that though!
Beautiful beautiful sceneries!
This rock is located in northern Matale district near Dambulla town.Don't enjoy a long morning in your bed and go early! The view it amazing the crowds going up as we were going back down were huge.
"This is a must do item in Sri Lanka. The climb is not continuous but it is difficult and single file. The top is spread out so you can get away from people a bit and get some beautiful photos. Our hotel hired a guide for us which was helpful. Wear sneakers and nothing that could cause you to trip. If your location allows you to, try and arrive when they open for less crowds and waiting in line up the ladders. We arrived about 9 and it was pretty crowded but when we left around 12 it was quiet so perhaps mid-day is good too. Please oh please do not bring children who cannot climb it on their own or disabled people. It's truly not safe."
try to go as early as possible to avoid crowds. walking the stairs up to be awarded with a view is worth it. Do get a local guide for cheap money for better understanding of the history of Sigirya
"Try to be there on a weekday @ 7am sharp and enjoy this amazing place in peace!
Easier climb than neighbouring Pidurangala Rock; but mind-blowing how they managed to build all of this on top fo this mountain!"
"Visited on a Sunday morning and it was packed. There were so many people we decided not to climb it would have taken many hours! We decided not to pay the $30usd then but to walk the perimeter that had some nice lakes and walking tracks. We did not however see the no drones sign and our driver didn’t warn us of this either so upon getting our drone out, even though we were well outside of the gates, within minutes an official was there going off. Lots of hassle, just be careful and don’t expect drone footage!"
"Very interesting place with a lot of history and a great view. You have to count of beeing here around 2,3-3,5 hours and the sun is shining stongly on the mountain so bring a lot of water and sunglasses It is quite windy on the mountain so do not ware skirt, dress, or hats. (As this is not a temple you do not need to cover the knees, so ware shorts and t-shirt, or sport cloths as you will be sweaty)."
The citadel is worth the wait. There is a long line due to the lack of infrastructure going up to the frescoes cave. I'd advise visitors to wake up early and try to be in line before 9 am. 
Sigiriya rock. 
"Entrance is $30USD per person— that means for my boyfriend and I, we paid $60USD to climb stairs to the top of a giant old rock."
"Had been looking forward to this as the highlight of my trip to Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, the site was so overcrowded that we were unable to climb up the rock - the early parts of the climb up stone steps are unfenced and there was plenty of jostling and some arguments. Just waiting for an accident to happen - saw a few close shaves."
"We had read a few scare stories before coming and were pleased to say it was not a terrifying as people made out. There are a lot of steps, but the place is slow and there are a lot of stops so it was fine. There were wasps but we went early and stayed quiet (the best advice) so they didn’t actually bother us. It is high, but the steps feel safe and you just don’t look down. There were a few dogs too, but all asleep. We definitely felt a sense of achievement when we got to the top and could relax and enjoy the views and ruins. The Museum, which we visited afterwards, was also informative. The best advice I think is to go early- we were there 7.30 and when we were leaving the crowds were pouring in."
To get the most out of the visit you need a guide to explain what you are seeing and the history. They also point out details you would miss. It is also worth noting that there are several bee nests near the final staircase which if disturbed will prevent you climbing the final staircase to the top of the rock.
You have to hike to the top. Lots of tourists on the paths and stairways so it’s slow going up but well worth it when you reach the top and see the view.
Over priced and get there early to avoid the crowds and long queues up the rock. View from the top is great not for those who are afraid of heights.
Started climb by 7am and definitely worth it due to increasing heat and noticeably busier by the time we were descending.  We hired a guide - definitely recommend doing so to understand full history of this amazing rock.
"This ancient World Heritage site is well worth the climb to the top. Yes, it's steep and narrow and a little bit hair raising in places but it was so crowded and our upward progress so slow that we never felt tired or needed to rest."
"If you’re very interested in the history of this place than go up, but I would not recommend it at all. Without stress and waiting less than 1,5hours (expect the Sri Lankan way of queueing with much body contact and queue jumping) it’s just possible in the early morning or late afternoon and the hardest thing is, that you (tourist) pay 4830R (30USD) and the locals pay 50R (0,30USD)."
This is an incredible UNESCO site and well worth your time to visit. 
You need to be fit and agile to get to the top. We got about half way but thought it was worthwhile. Lots of monkeys on the way.
"Simply a must - yes it’s a lot of steps, but make sure you start as close to 7am as you can to beat the heat and crowds, then you can stop and rest as many times as you need on the way up and down. All up we spent about 80mins in total from bottom to top and down again including at least 25-30mins at the top enjoying the view and different parts of the ruins. By no means were we racing. We took our time as needed. Most parts the stairs are an easy to med climb. "
"We went as part of our tour of Sri Lanka and to be honest, I felt it was a ""must do"" on the trip. We went fairly early in the morning and even then it was very crowded, although having seen photos on Trip Advisor, I realise it wasn't actually too bad. Due to the number of people we were forced to climb at a fairly slow, steady pace (luckily!!) and it was only the heat that made it feel rather strenuous. There are plenty of places to stop and take a break if you do feel tired along the way. The final stage of the climb might be tricky if you fear heights, but it is literally climbing a metal stair-case with a hand-rail, which means there is no need to look down if you would rather not. We sat for quite a while up the top under a shaded tree taking in the view. The trek down was lovely - we saw very few people and couldn't believe how quickly we made it down. Take plenty of water to drink along the way!"
Great place to visit and see history of rich Sri Lankan culture. Must visit the museum before climbing the rock.
"For those of you who like me aren't too fond of heights fear not....it's not as scary as it looks. It's well worth the effort to get to the top, great views. It's a fairly long walk up but there are plenty of places to stop for a break, again I didn't find the walk as tiring as I had feared. Try to go early, we got there about 9.30 but it was already quite crowded. Guides are available but you don't really need one. "
"A lot of history here in a spectacular location, one of my favourite tourist sites in Sri Lanka. Visit the museum and gardens before you climb Sigiriya Rock for background information and artist impressions of how the palace and associated buildings and landscaping might have appeared. The climb is steep but not too hard as you're going up stairs at the pace of the slowest person in the crowd. Everyone is friendly and patient and you're there before you know it. There was a nice breeze up on top so very pleasant exploring. It's sunny and exposed, you'll need to hold onto your hat."
"It is a steep climb and of course it is likely to be hot. There are points where you can stop to rest, but just take your time and water. Go early or later in the afternoon when it is cooler and there are likely to be fewer visitors. Take a guide to explain the history of the site. The fortress at the top is large and the views are panoramic. Hold onto your hat as it is refreshingly breezy at the top. It took us just under two hours up and down."
"We cycled 20km on back roads to get to the area yet the kids still had no trouble to get up and down the ~1000 steps to get to the top. It was a hot day but manageable in small portions. Young kids are likely to require carrying to come prepared and bring all your snacks and drinks as once you are on the climb, there is nothing. It’s a well worth hike with spectacular scenery with amazing views all around. The guides went into far too much detail for our family but they were pleasant and helped us all the way. I can see this hike being challenging for the elderly but there are rest stops all the way up. We didn’t really find it a challenge to make it up even carrying a 2yr old. We had good weather to do the hike which made the day."
"Top tip: after you’ve got your ticket from the museum (foreigners only) and you enter the citadel, depending on the time of day you go, you’ll hit a huge, slow moving queue leading up the stairs. Take a right turn just as the stairs begin to ascend. You’ll come across one alternative set of steps that the guides (slyly) have blocked off to boost their trade of queue jumping short cuts. But if you follow the path around further to the right you will see another set of steps leading up that cuts out the vast majority of the queue. Look out for wealthier travellers following a guide up this route and you’ll know you’re on the right track. Take plenty of water as it gets hot. It’ll be worth it. The views are spectacular, enjoy!"
"The handrail and steps had shown some corrosion and the place need more signs to guide you to point of interest and how to exit, some direction to guide tourist to explore will be very helpful so you don’t waste too much time and effort walking around and about."
"A UNESCO World Heritage site, but our visit was spoilt by the large crowds on a weekend. To be fair we should have arrived earlier, possibly before 9AM. Trust ,your Touareg guide and make sure you don’t end up in the very long queue to see the frescoes. Als9 be aware that this is a very expensive place to visit - $30."
"When our group arrived at Sigiriya I must admit I thought how on earth am I gonna climb all the way to the top of that rock! Step by step is the answer - all 1236 of them. It was challenging at times as there were a lot of people coming and going, but the reward was the views once at the top. The history of the place was well told to us by our guide and I think that makes it all the more worthwhile when you know the story of the Lion Rock. Would definitely recommend this as a must do when in Sri Lanka,"
"As this is a touted ""must-do"" of any Sri Lanka trip, tourists flock there each day by the hundreds, if not thousands. We noted there were quite a number of locals visiting the rock at the time of visit, as our trip in August coincided with school holidays in Sri Lanka."
"It didn't seem like I climbed 1,200 steps! It wasn't that hard of a climb. A few others in my group got just a little winded on the way up, but they still enjoyed the climb. The view from top is well worth the effort!!! Jayantha, our tour guide, gave us the history all the way to the top. He took pictures of our group and went at our pace. The weather was great and the views were amazing!!! This was one of the highlights of our trip to Sri Lanka! If you aren't sure, just do it!"
"Great place to visit! Loved it. Some views from top.
Be sure to get there as soon as opens! Price is 30 usd.."
"Well worth the trip. Not much more to add. Would be good to spend some time at the top. So allow plenty of time to climb,"
"This is suited to those who like history, architecture and a nice hike, it's a little challenging in places but the views from the top are very much worth it - as are the cave paintings you see during the climb. The achievement architecturally speaks for itself!"
"This is suited to those who like history, architecture and a nice hike, it's a little challenging in places but the views from the top are very much worth it - as are the cave paintings you see during the climb. The achievement architecturally speaks for itself!"
"It’s a beautiful place, a short trek only sad part was the whole trek we had to form a que and 1.5 hrs walk took us almost 3-4 to complete as it was crowded. Entrance fare is 50% lesser for SARAAC nationals, so do carry your passport. View from the top is really beautiful. "
"On arrival, after all the hustle of getting tickets and avoiding a million tourists taking selfies before the start of their climb, you do stand there in awe at the rock and wonder if you are up to it. I have to admit, physically it was tricky but more than doable as there are opportunities along the way to stop and catch your breath if needed. It’s more the challenge of fears I encountered. It was a scary climb and at times I was terrified. The steepness, it felt unstable even though it wasn’t but make the effort to go to the top. It is definitely worth all the effort to have the cool breeze that hits you when you get there and the views are amazing. Coming down is swift and easier. Go early as coach loads arrive mid morning and it’s then really overcrowded."
If you genuinely have vertigo then Sigiriya Rock probably isn’t for you but don’t be put off by reviews saying it’s a hard climb. I’m late 50s and reasonably fit but no tri-athlete and did it in 30 – 40 minutes with just one stop at the Lions Pays. 
"We arrived by tuk tuk (recommend Thilina +94712714790 also has home stay) and the driver took us directly to the ticket building. We picked up our tickets at 7am and headed to the rock first. There were already a good number of people ascending. Be aware the some parts are steep and narrow (not for those with vertigo). The handrails are old and rusty so be prepared for sticky, orange stained hands. The views at the top are breathtaking! The descent is the same route and navigation through those coming up is tricky. This was an early walk any later would be very unpleasant due to the increasing number of people."
Interesting place with an impressive rock. The gardens are worth to visit and the view from the top of the rock is fantastic. We went there very early in the morning but the site was already overcrowded. I wonder if it would not be better to go there at the end of the day...
I was looking forward to visiting this site ever since i decided to come to Sri lanka and let me say it lived up to it.
one and half hours to climb to the top where the view is absolutely stunning. Highly recommended for all travelling to Sri Lanka
We decided to visit Lion rock after much debate and being told that Pedingula (probably spelt wrong!) was better as it is only 500 rupees.
"would recommend for everybody to talk the walk up and see the sights it is amazing, there are a lot of people there but they get scattered around a big place so it should not bother you that much"
We decided to climb this instead of Pidurangala rock as we were told that this had better views of Sigiriya and has stairs all the way to the top (apparently getting to the top of Pidurangala is like an obstacle course).
"I was really unsure about going due to the entrance cost being US$30 but I read some reviews and went anyway and I have to say that it was such a great experience. I did get a guide which cost $20 as it had been recommended to do this from a Sri Lankan friend to understand the site in depth. I have to say he definitely also helped out with keeping the monkeys and dogs away! The flight of stairs to the paintings are definitely not for the faint hearted but it all added to the experience. The climb to the top of the mountain, entering at the lion’s feet, was so interesting. It was very windy so wear something that will not blow up with a gust of wind! Also I went around 11am and it wasn’t too, too busy, for those who are not able to make the early morning slot! "
We arrived at around 9.30am and the queues were already in place. Due to the volume of people we had to take it slow (needed anyway as a bit of a climb). The views are beautiful and I’m glad we did it however the price is absurd ($30) and the crowds are a bit much. It would definitely be better earlier or slightly off season-we have to travel during school holidays which means places are always busier
"Amazing views from the top, so even if you’re lazy and unfit like myself, the climb is definitely worth it. The downside was the unending mass of people, moving at a constant steady pace, but we went at about 3pm - possibly the busiest time! If heights aren’t your thing you might want to give this a miss. My boyfriend had to bow out when we got to the metal spiral staircase. Also the fear of awakening the swarms of bees and being attacked (as per the warning signs) will keep you alert enough to save any boredom mid-climb. "
"I am horribly afraid of heights and climbing a 600ft rock was not at the top of my list for this holiday! However, it was amazing and takes about 1 hour to make the climb via some fantastic, ancient rock art and it is certainly worth the climb to discover the ruins of the most amazing palace. I am still afraid of heights but sometimes you just have to seize these opportunities."
We expected this climb to be strenuous but were pleasantly surprised with how easy we found it. We also saw lots of monkeys which was a lovely treat. 
"We were there on a Sunday in August (around noon). We saw the long queue, nevertheless we decided to try to go up. - What a mistake!"
"It looks very impressive and difficult from the bottom but the climb is not as hard as it looks. It is a bit steep at times, especially the last part, but the view from the top is well worth the effort. I don’t particularly like heights and was a bit worried about it but I never felt uncomfortable ... a must if you visit Sri Lanka!"
Exciting climb to the top. Nowhere near as hard as it looks. Amazing view along the way and at the top. The most fascinating thing is to consider how they managed to create what they did at the top of this rock all those years ago. A must-visit place. Definitely advisable to arrive early though. 
One of the highlights of our trip to Sri Lanka. Amazing scenery and history. The climb is quiet steep in parts but you can go at your own pace. The views are superb. The cave paintings are incredible. Be wary of the monkeys and be ready for the salesmen at the bottom but at least attempt to climb as far as you body will let you!
This is a must-see! Was definitely one of the highlights of our trip! We went up at in the late afternoon and saw the sunset. Simply amazing.
"Needless to say that this was a terrific excursion, the reason why people flock to Sigiriya. Highly recommend to start early in the morning at the time of opening (7am) to avoid the crowd & the afternoon heat. Takes about ~2 hours (+/- 15 mins depending on your speed). While up on the rock, spend good time to enjoy the view."
"Centered on a massive rock rising 200 meters above the surrounding plain, Sigiriya’s location is one of considerable natural beauty and historical interest. An area of ancient settlement lying between the historic capitals of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, the Sigiriya plain still retains much of its forest cover, and many of its present village settlements. "
What an amazing insight to the past. Would definitely advise an early start as it got very busy as we climbed down. Amazing history when you stop to read the plaques. We has a guide and this made all the difference to cover things we may have missed. The views along the way were outstanding. The cave was limited due to the single entrance for entry and exit not a major issue at 7.15am but could be an issue if busy. The steps up are a little to endure and the metal steps are deceptive as some are very small step inclines. Amazing views a place worth visiting.
"We did both the Pidurangala Rock and this. Both were interesting experiences of their own for us and had magnificent views from the TOP. We learned a lot from a local guide whom we paid an extra $20 for to share the history and explain the different areas of the Lion Rock to us. The climb up was actually more bearable for us because of the huge crowd as we could go very slowly. I didn’t break much of a sweat up compared to Pidurangala. We went on a Sunday early morning and everyone was there too. It was windy so it was not too hot for us. At the lion’s paws and on the top, we had to wait to seize the right opportunity for photos as there were many people waiting for one too. Group tours dominate the crowd, but there were also many locals during this holy weekend. We also enjoyed a nice walk along the moats."
"This is an impressive site, showing signs of an advanced old civilization. The fortress / palace is accessible through thousands of steps. I was not able to climb, but I could get a very good idea of the place by visiting the excellent museum they have."
"Good to start early so that you miss the crowd. Do get a guide too so that you can better understand the history of the place. There's 1200 steps to climb but it's completely doable. For people who are afraid of heights, you have to know that it's gets really high at the top! So if you are scared of heights be aware! "
Best in class world heritage site with amazing views from the top. This is a must do site when visiting Sri Lanka as its centrepiece is a castle built on top of a huge rock and it’s  history dates back to the 3rd century BC.
"This place is incredible in terms of the scale of what was built and existed so long ago. The walk around the ruins and outer moats is lovely. We were there early afternoon, so it was hot but not crowded. Once you get to the main rock the steps and climb get quite steep which was fine for us but needs good shoes. To climb the spiral staircase and the final steep staircase on the front of the rock requires a good head for heights. If that is not for you there is a nice flat, open, shady area at the base to watch the other climbers and monkeys. Definitely a must do in Sri Lanka, once inside the paths are clear and signed so no need to pay any extra for a guide"
"I was very sceptical about this place, but it blew my mind!"
"We used LocoMole, a newly launched experiential app by the Ministry of Tourism to explore Sigiriya by ourselves. The app uses a combination of location-based technologies such as GPS & AR, Storytelling, Suggested To-Dos and Gamified content to make exploration this amazing UNESCO World Heritage site both fun and engaging using one’s own smartphone devices."
Well with a visit but get there early as it was so busy even at 9am. We had to queue the whole way up with took away from the experience slightly!

"Once you get past the price and the crowds, this is an amazing place. Even though it was never quite finished, the skill and effort to control and manage water throughout the complex, and the enable the plastering and painting over such large areas of exposed and often overhanding rock, takes the breath away. On top of that, no pun intended, as you climb, and when you reach to top, the views are amazing. Your one chance to spend some time in relative peace, is to aim to stay at the top until sunset when, with luck, the sun and cloud will oblige you. Don't leave it too late to go to the top as there are cut off times for making the ascent, around 4.30pm, from memory, but check when you are there. Allow time to explore the grounds, visit the museum, and explore the rock."
"Something to do ! Take a comfy shoes and a lot of water, very windy on the top. 
Better do it in the early morning when it's not too hot. 
From the top you can see the green power of Sri Lanka."
This was an amazing visit. Loved the whole experience even though the there were allot of stairs involved!
"We didn't time our visit well and didn't start our trek up until 11am on a hot July day. Yes it was sticky and at times crowded but it was still worth it. What an amazing, historical place. Truly awe inspiring. The climb is pretty straight forward as long as you are in reasonable health. Our five year old had no trouble at all. My only caution is when going up/down to the very top hold on to your children's hands as small children can easily slip through the safety rails. If you have any fear of heights, you're best to stay at the lion's paw as the final stretch up is not for the faint hearted. "
Excellent walk... Take your time and it's not difficult. USD30 admission and they took USDs as well as rupees. Lots to look at on the way up and down and worth spending time at the top.
"It's a wonderful creation of a human. Water gardern, border gardern amazing.  Unbelievable construction. 
Wall arts unbelievable, 
Must  start early as possible as more when crowd comes difficult."
Don’t miss this place if you are in the neighborhood. We spent a good 4 hours on the site. There were so much to see and experience. You are thrown back in time and walk through history.
This was one of the most expensive attractions we went to in sri lanka. It was amazing to see but I thought the views were better from pidarangala rock opposite. Lots and lots of stairs! Worth going all the way to the top.
"You are probably reading this as you are having the same dilemma as we did, do you cough up $30 each to go and see this place?? Or do you pay 500 rupees and climb Pidurangala (the hill opposite) to see Sigiriya. We diliberated about this and asked locals and travelers. In the end we did both! And we did not regret it. We loved Sigiriya, it is pricey, however if you go to the museum and explore the whole grounds as well as climbing to the top you get the most out of your money. The history is amazing and I recommend going to the museum before or after the hike up as you appreciate what it looked like all those years ago. "
"Definitely go early to beat the heat and tourists. I suggest 7am. We were amazed at the cues as we were descending.You do want to be confident with heights if climbing to the top, though stairs and hand rails are everywhere. We were two families of 8, make sure to arrange with your driver and all the party are aware where to meet at the end, In our party a couple of the kids ended up back at the beginning, as there are several ways out! Was easily sorted with the locals and the drivers all looking out. It just showed us how the locals are genuinely looking after and care about the tourists."
"So much walking and not all of it requires going up stairs! Actually, even if you don't want to reach the top, there are some stairs to navigate when you decide to depart. "
"we visited here without a guide with us, tickets are very expensive only for foreigners, the rock gets really hot when sun comes up, dont forget to bring water bottles and a hat with you."
Wonderful breath taking rock with an amazing 360 view over the forest. Just make sure you wear a sneakers or a comfy pair of shoes coz there are over a 1000 steps to take
"This is an interesting piece of SriLankan history. Beautiful to behold, challenging to climb and amazing views from the top. Go early to avoid the heat and the crowds and wear sensible shoes. The climb is challenging but I have a very dodgy knee and coped okay. Very little information about the rock on site so read up before you go. "
This is a UNESCO site and considered a must visit if you are in Sri Lanka.. The history of a late King building his fort there is something worth checking out.
Some people says it's the 8th wonder of the world. 
"We were advised to visit this site either early morning or late afternoon when cooler as you have to do some climbing. The ascent is easier than it initially looks as there are plenty of places to rest after reaching the various levels up the steps. The site and views are amazing and well worth the climb. We also visited the water gardens ( saw a crocodile in the lake), a kingfisher on the lily pond outside the museum and the boulder area where the monks lived. Entry is quite steep being 30$ each but it is something memorable and not to be missed."
"It's rather expensive, costing nearly 5000 Sri Lankan Rupees to enter for foreigners. Of course, it's an impressive site, and I recommend a guided tour (it was organized for us beforehand, I'm not sure where you can get a guide) as we learned a lot of interesting facts I otherwise wouldn't have. Best to go very early in the day, as after 10 am it gets very warm. Bring plenty of water as the only place you can buy drinks is by the parking lot and you will be incredibly thirsty climbing this place in this dry area."
This is a must visit if you have traveled to Sri Lanka. Has a lot of history and the guides are very knowledgeable.
A must visit if you are able to climb the Lion rock.The views from the top are amazing and you can see for miles. Please make sure that you have walking shoes. Best time to climb is early morning as it gets very hot later part of the day.
"Lion Rock is definately a must do when visiting Sigiriya. You’ll break a sweat, go up a lot of stairs but the view is incredible and its beauty is definately worth it."
The whole area is really impressive and at each corner you can find a big piece of history. The entrance fee 4500 rs on the other side seemed to me pretty high. The tuk tuk one way from Dambulla costed 1000 rs. On the way back it was 1200 rs. The bus is much cheaper on the other goes much longer and with tuk tuk was possible to save in our case like 50 minutes...
Completely agree with everyone who says start early. I did to try and beat the heat but now realise you must to be there before the crowds.
"The price may seem a bit steep but this UNESCO world heritage site is worth the effort as a major piece of Sri Lankan history. As others have said, definitely go early- not just because of the heat, but to avoid It getting too crowded. Even by the time we were coming down at 10.30 the crowds were building. "
Lots of steps - yes but really it was over before we had begun.
"Steep climb that requires moderate fitness, but well worth the effort as view from top is good and the history is very interesting. Make sure to take plenty of sun protection and water. Some of the steps are scary for those afraid of heights or suffer from vertigo (particularly those which go to the frescoes, but you can avoid those if you want to). Expensive entry price for foreigners because UNESCO location."
"It's a shame that they make tourists pay an expensive fee while it's free for local citizens, and on the day there was a whole schoolful of children visiting, so the queue was so enormous we didn't make it to the top due to lack of time. Apart form this it's highly recommended to visit this Heritage Site."
"This would be a nice place to visit. Story is nice and historic and some amazing ancient structures. Too many people for my liking though and it ruined the whole experience. Also $30USD is a joke. There's one entrance for Sri Lankan's one for tourists. Also signposting very bad. We could not find the ""exit"" car park to find our driver. This needs to improve if you want to keep attracting people. I will tell anyone not to bother with this. Not worth the time, effort or money."
"I love history and its kind of a cool story how the King fortified it and ruled from it from 400AD, but the crowds were insane. Literally queuing the whole way up with horrible people trying to push in and squeeze their way through. Most people had no respect for personal space and would literally squash you into a rock if it meant they could get in front of you. Ruined my whole experience. It was ok at the top but nothing breathtaking. Also if you've been to Rome or seen any of the ancient roman ruins this will be below par for you. If you're gonna go make sure you go as early as possible so the ignorant people don't ruin it for you."
"Don't enjoy a long morning in your bed and go early! This will make a huge difference. Couldn't imagine it would be so crowded! We were almost alone when we got up to the top. At the moment we started our descent, I couldn't believe the stairs were all fully packed with people waiting one behind the other to go up. The view is worth the effort. But the stairs can turn of a lot of people... No hight fear allowed...! It could be a challenge when you see thru the stairs at this hight."
"no words to say. it is fantastic and really interesting site, its a must to see if you are in sri lanka, have many water ways and kings, palace was awesome,"
"...... you can take the softer option and tuk-tuk around the rock. We chose the soft option and it was good fun. The driver took us to several great vantage points for photos. If your driver asks if you want to take the long detour to see the lake, definitely do it. It is not a great road but you have great views across to both Sigiriya and Pidurangala."
Didn’t think we could do it but we did. We arrived early to beat the heat and crowds and it wasn’t too bad. You can take your time so there’s no rush. The views are amazing and beautiful. It isn’t easy and the heat makes it worse so go early. There are spots along the way to rest and take pictures but otherwise it’s single file in some areas. Bring water...it’s essential! Well worth doing! 
"Despite being warned about big crowds and arriving at “peak hour”, it really wasn’t that bad. When you get to the top there is a rewarding cooling breeze!"
We climbed the rock at opening to beat the crowds and heat.
One of my best memory ever i will remember it for tge rest of my life ..amazing place it was a real advanter to reach the top with my wife and small daughter ..really it worth and you must vist it if you head to sri lanka
"Visited Sigiraya with 2 friends today, not realising it was a public holiday! Despite the crowds we had a brilliant time and the views from the top are stunning."
"No visit to Sri Lanka with out a visit to Sigriya Rock. You see it on every turist book and every post card and every poster in Colombo airport, so of course you have to go and see it live. We started walking up at around 8 am in the morning. There were lots of people but more coming on our way down. It is an amazing walk up all the stairs, but only if you are use to walking and don't have problems with hights. We meet several of people doing this trip who should have just enjoyed the rock from a distance - it is not worth the hard work, if you hardly can breath or if your body does not cope with the many stairs - the stairs comes in different hights and ""qualities"" - it is not a Disneyland. BUT if you make it, it is amazing and the view is fantastic from the top."
"Although the day was hot (nearly 40Degs C) we had a good time. We had a good guide who explained as best as he can on the history of the place. Make sure you wear appropriate clothes, men with at least three quarter pants and ladies the same. The rule no showing of knees and shoulders. Great place visit. Try to choose cooler months."
This is definitely an amazing place to visit! There are no toilets or drink facilities once you go passed the entrance so bring liquid with you! There were many sections of steps so just set your own pace and don’t go too fast. You will need to rest on your way up (down not so much).
Ideally I think you should get here in the morning when it is cooler but we drove from Negombp so arrived at 12. We had a quick look around the museum after paying our entrance( $30/ 4770 rupees) then started our walk over the moats and up the approach.
"The entrance is not cheap but this is so worth it! If you are in relatively good shape it's not difficult at all to get up there. I read a lot of reviews before going there and was really expecting much more difficulty. BUT the biggest difficulty might be fear of heights for lots of people. It's possible someone will offer their help to get you up there, but that is actually their job and they will expect you to pay them... It's not so much money but good to be aware of that. On the top of the rock the view is amazing and this place carries so much history. The ticket includes entrance to the museum, there you can watch a short video where they made a reconstruction of what it might have looked like up there at the time. Really incredible! "
"Not to be missed, its sheer beauty.  Go early (7am) to avoid the crowd and congestion on the steps.  Bit windy up top so bring a light jacket."
Sigiriya rock is definitely must see when you are in Sri Lanka.
"Sigiriya is an amazing place. The whole complex is just mesmerising. The Lion Rock itself is it's centrepiece obviously, and rightly so. It's a tough climb in the heat and you'll need a modicum of fitness and plenty of patience as much of it rough rock steps or steep metal stairs that vmcan be narrow. Plenty of rest stops available so take your time! The views from the top are worth the haul! "
"Sigiriya is magnificent, one the highlights of our trip to Sri Lanka, no doubt about it."
"Its a harrowing climb, and not for the fain of heart or those truly scared of heights, but it is so worth it. 
The view is unbeatable, and if you have any interest in ancient civilizations, you will be rightfully impressed."
An amazing historical Sri Lankan heritage site. Stunning views from the summit. Top tip - aim to get there by 8am to avoid the queues and the heat!
Entrance to Sigiriya cost $30 USD. I think they only took cash. There is a museum that is very informative and after that you can start to explore the grounds. The hike up has many stairs so be aware and bring water. The views from the top were beautiful. 
You will need to be fit but he e views from the top are amazing. The frescoes are overrated but where they are is a feat of skill and daring. If you are afraid of spiral staircases and sheer drops then this is not for you
"Yes it’s a big climb, but totally worth it! Get there as early as possible to avoid the heat and crowds ( opens at 7 I think) Take a moment to research the history and then imagine it as you walk through the grounds past the walls of moats and ruins of buildings. Your quads will love the workout - don’t be daunted by the steepness, there are railings all the way. Go slow on the way down though. The top has magnificent views and spend some time wandering up here to see the old fortress. Watch for cheeky monkeys on the way down "
"If you must choose only one thing to do in Sri Lanka, this is the one! A bit expensive and a lot of stairs, but totally worth it! I was there for sunset and the view was stunning! You should definitely go at sunrise (if you are an early bird) or at sunset."
They say it's 1200 odd steps. We made it. All the way up there are places to stop and admire the view. Plus however bad you feel you won't regret it at the top (and there is always someone struggling more than you ☺). On the way up you really get to appreciate the amount of work that went into it. 
"Big climb but tottaly worth it! In my opinion its the most beautiful atracttion in Sri Lanka, the view on the top is simply stunning."
Worth the climb with a panoramic view of surrounding area. But go early when there are few tourists; I arrived around 7 a.m. and left after 9 a.m. 
If you have a good guide like we have been lucky enough to have then you will know the history before you arrive to begin the climb. Shame the museum isn’t being better looked after but at least the relics are... 
Visited today at around 4 pm started climbing sweted alot the entry points are lack of guide line sign boards but afterwards when u enter there are checkpoints around 43 in the end its view is breath taking. Street dogs were always there when you try to relax and start to take out something to eat so beware
"Visiting the Sigiriya Rock is definitely one of the highlights when touring Sri Lanka. The ancient capital city built on a rock as a fortress by a rebellious monarch has many fascinating stories from the past. The architecture and facilities cannot simply be comprehended considering the era that it was built, due to non availability of heavy machinery during that time. One side of the rock is yet to be explored and it is reported that excavations in new areas have commenced with new artifacts being unearthed. It was pleasing to note that new facilities have been introduced to visitors. It is recommended to be at the gate early morning to enjoy a leisurely and less crowded climb to the top."
"i must warm! that my rating is unfair since i did not actually climb. What frustrated me even more is after driving through half a day from Colombo, my travel guide recommended me to not climb up the stairs as it was risky, over priced and difficult for kids."
Easy walk and historic. Lovely view and was worth it. Did go to the other rick again very easy walk up.
"Impressive, amazing and a must seen.
Unfortunately a bit overcrowded.
But still worth to see and  to climb up to the Lion‘ rock."
"Well worth climbing.  Amazing story and architecture.  But set off early to avoid the heat and allow a good couple of hours.

And a little bit daunting towards to top if you have any fear of heights. But plenty of local helpers and worth it!"
"To be honest I was skeptical about going to Sigiriya. I only went because my friend wanted to see it. In the end, she was nursing a sick child, but I went ahead with my family and the remnants of hers. It was way better than I expected but I think that is because we decided to pay for a guide. The guide just added so much depth and colour to what we were seeing and helped us to really understand some the engineering marvels at the site. He also helped us to understand the steep entrance fees. The site is run by UNESCO not the Sri Lankan government and UNESCO set the fees to put towards heritage."
"Much has been written about this fascinating World Heritage site and its worth reading what you can before you arrive. I need say no more. But two points for the relevant tourist or culture depts: I) the museum designed and built by the Japanese and kept very clean, needs repainting - with at least 250+ tourists visiting every day each paying $30, they can surely afford it; 2) there are a number of men, all polite and intending to be helpful, soliciting to be guides. At least five approached us and it becomes trying. I do not want someone following me around and talking at me."
"The best part of my trip.  the view is amazing.  so worth the trip to the top.  do it!! seeing the ridges in the rock, makes you wonder about the reason for them so many years ago."
"This was my highlight of Sri Lanka. A must see. the trip up to the top of the rock was so worth the many many many stairs. thank goodness i had a friend with me. we encouraged each other to keep going. and Wow, so worth it. the view from the top is amazing. understanding the history behind it was useful."
It has been the second time I went there. (21 years passed by)
"I was not aware of the wonderful ancient history and cultural / engineering achievements of the Sri Lankan people until I spent 3 days in the cultural triangle. One site that is a must see in the triangle is Sigiriya rock. The story of the patricide King who built it combined with the architectural and gardening achievements his 'teams' built into the rock and surrounding landscape is astounding. You have to see it with your own eyes, as I was blown away -- furthermore, I suggest doing a quick read about the place before going. Also recommend 1) Hiring a UNESCO World Heritage site trained guide, 2) Going early in the morning. We arrived at 8 AM opening, and were in the lead pack of bussed-in hordes quickly building behind us. Plus, you'll beat the heat. 3) Wear comfy shoes. 4) Bring water and lastly, 5) Stow your fear of heights."

This is a place which will excite the nature and trekking freaks....choose wise and start early else you will be baked under the scorching sun. Sigiriya Rock Fortress is 200 mts from ground and one needs to take about 1200 steep steps to reach.
Recommend this site! Lots of stairs to climb and can get very busy based on the time of year but overall worth the visit. Views are amazing.  Recommend a guided tour to learn more about the history.
Husband and I visited this site in December. It is a must see attraction. It was the busy season so lines to climb up the rock were long and it was very crowded - lots of stairs. Climbing down was less busy and much easier. Recommend going with a guide who can narrate the history of the place. View from the top is amazing.
"One of the best historic site in Sri Lanka.
An amazing place. We went with site guide who explains the history. 
We have no word to express. 
But you should visit there."
Visited with children who have not visited this place before. My third visit. For me this visit was more informative. Saw more areas than in my previous visits. Children enjoyed the challenge of climbing the rock. Toilet facilities are poor.
"I do realise I visited during tourist season but had I the chance to do it again I would endure the increased heat of the afternoon for less tourists (and school children). The guides I read suggested early morning start but when we arrived at 8am, it was already heaving. By the time we left (1.30pm) there was almost no one coming in. Be that as it may, beautiful scenery, beautiful walk and beautifully preserved by the gardeners and conservationists employed there. Take bottles of water!!..... there is a refilling station near the top so even if you drink all on the way up there you can get more. "
"This rock is probably one of the most visited tourist attraction in Sri Lanka. The entrance fee for foreigner is about 30 USD, which can be quite expensive, but definitely worth the climb up. From the top of the rock, you can a great view that overlooks rivers and mountains. The breeze at the top is unbeatable as well. Just do expect some crowd during the weekends. "
"A must do in the area, a bit more explanation would be good and advised, you have to read the flyer and visit the museum. A spoken headset would be top. Due to this I’m sure that you missed some nice details. So do some research upfront and it is great."
"You have to visit this, not recommended for People who have freer for heights. You have to have a moderate condition as there are a lot op steps to take. Pretty crowded, but all goos good. Look for protection of sun and heat if temperature is high. Start early to avoid high temperature and people. A must do if you are here ."
I was lucky to have guide otherwise you might just be walking around and don't get the full history of the place. I was lucky the sun was not beating down so it made walking up the 1200 steps bearable. Certainly the view from the top is worth going up. The remains of the lion head and rock paintings were worth the walk. Check out the sanscript carving on the mirror wall.
"Excellent Experience 💯 

Sigiriya today is a UNESCO listed World Heritage Site. It is one of the best preserved examples of ancient urban planning"
"This is well worth the time and effort for an amazing experience at the end of the climb. The crowds were thin on the day we climbed and that probably made it much easier than those who do during the busy months. I would suggest a guide who can explain everything that you see as this really enhances the experience and because things are not well sign posted. There are some very precarious stages and those with vertigo will enjoy a crash course in overcoming it. The wall paintings are good to see on the way up but the real delight is the view at the top. A word of caution, on the last few hundred stairs you ""will"" be offered help by ""guides"" laying in wait. I strongly recommend firmly declining as they will be asking large amounts of money for assisting you with the last few steps. The history and view make the effort well worthwhile."
This site is magnificient and a puts especially the european gardening history into perspective. 500 AD the garden and the royal palace at the top of the rock was established. Stairs to to the too if the rock might be a little difficult for older people but the rest of us must get up on the top of the rock. Impressive although the restoration not seems to be done professionally. Get up there and get a glimpse of royal palace from 500 AD.
"Incredible Unesco world heritage site and wonder of the world. 1200 steps, sheer rock, incredible frescos (alert: you cannot take photos and they are serious), ruins at top. Lovely grounds, interesting museum. The museum had incredible artifacts and good explanations of the site as well as copies of the frescos. The grounds are lovely and I would have wanted to spend more time but our time was limited so we just climbed the Lion Rock. Absolutely recommend."
"It was a great experience. More than 1200+ steps climb. If you are from SAARC countries, please remember to carry your passport to get 50% discount on the ticket price."
Beautiful site and view from the top. Top tip- pay a TukTuk driver instead of a hotel tour. It’s is much cheaper and the only difference is that no food is provided.
A great little walk to the top that wasn’t too scary for our 11 year old that was nervous about the height and also the wasps. None to be seen. The guide we used was ok but to be honest wasn’t really needed. Plenty of signs to explain the history etc. Good exercise for the day 
"Definitely best done with a guide, it is up a lot of steps and not good if you do not have a head for heights but view from the top is stunning as is the recess with the frescos"
Both the ruins at the top of the rock and the surrounding gardens are well worth a visit. The view from the top is amazing. Visit early to beat the heat.
It is not just the rock that is amazing but the history and the remains of the surrounding gardens are well worth a visit. Best to go early to beat the heat
Very interesting but not for people with Vertigo like me made it 2/3 up the way but test of the family went all the way up . Stairs are ok but a bit wobbly here and there. The hornets was no problem when we were there and the monkeys also behaved. It is a must see in our book
"The grounds are huge and immaculately maintained, we had a guide guide us around as part of our tour, tickets are approx $30 each, and approx. 2000 visitors a day come to see this attraction making it the most popular tourist attraction in Sri Lanka. The guide was great in providing the background, history and outlining the significance of certain parts. It was quite windy on the way up. At the start there’s a 10minutes flat walk in and then there are steps in blocks of 7-10, one block followed by a walk and then another block, of you take it slowly it’s fine. Then at the foot of the lions rock (midway) there’s are another set of stairs which are more intense to get you to the top, these I found more strenuous, but as it was non stop as ppl are behind you, it felt harder. At the top there’s the kings swimming pool and some ruins but of more interest was a picturesque scenery of just luscious greenery, the view of the national parks was beautiful! "
Definitely a ‘must see’ when visiting Sri Lanka. Be prepared for a climb. The steps are a little challenging but the ruins and views are amazing!!!! Beautifully preserved historic area. Don’t miss it!
It is a unique creation of ancient Sri Lankan kings which is a 'must visit' places in Sri Lanka. Despite of the fact it is a little crowded during a few days and also facilities being not enough to cater to travellers demand such as toilets etc. historic architecture built on a summit of will take your breath away. 
"Amazing place. Don’t miss this! Getting up those stairs are hard but once you’re up, it’s beautiful!"
Amazing view at the top and ‘fun’ walk up. Very expensive just for a ticket and a leaflet . As your walk up there is real information just signs telling you what not to walk on. Would of liked some information boards just to learn a few things as you were walking up - needed a travel book give us some information.
We enjoyed the climb (wasn't as hard as we had imagined it to be). It gets hot really early so be there as early as you can and avoid the heat of the day. Take water and wear solid foot ware. It is 30 USD per person and kids under 12 are 15 USD. 
This is an Amazing place on earth. Probably the 8th wonder of the world. Get Travel Guide's assistance. They will explain you all the details and show you all the important places. 
This rock is located in northern Matale district near Dambulla town and i must say that this is one of the best attractions that Srilanka has to offer. It is historical and archaeological sight that is dominated by a massive column of rock nearly 200 meters high. The palace was built by the king kasyapa at the top of the rock
"It is an amazing place for History, Hiking (walkers), Painting lovers."
"Whilst pricey to get in at 30USD, the site is amazing. The gardens by themselves are a fascinating and in an impressive condition and as you climb up the rock itself the frescoes are stunning."
We unknowingly went early on a full moon public holiday meaning a 4 hour queue to the top. However this was a great experience in itself surrounded by excited locals!! However be prepared for this if you go on a public holiday!!
To climb the top of rock is guite hard job. Go early morning this place. In the heat of midday climbing to up can he really heavy job. Midway of climbing you can se beatiful Friscossa. No photos allowed. At the you have grate view. This place is very crowded. If you want to take a litllebit easier Stepa take the right side.
"First you can go to Museum to buy tickets for this area. Places were very beatiful, Green and clean. You can take very nice photos here. You must go true gardens before climbing to lion rock."
"This place is amazing. We got a guide, which helped bring the place to life around the history and facts. The view at the top is great and my 2 young kids made it up fine (with some sweets as bribery). Take plenty of water."
"It’s a fairly strenuous climb and not great for those with no head for heights but boy, was it worth it ! Go early, it gets crowded and hot later. The beauty and the wonder of a very sophisticated civilisation with great engineering so long ago, is astonishing. "
"ising 200 meters vertically from the flat pains, Sigiriya Rock provides you with one of the most dramatic sites in Sri Lanka. Top of this rock contains ruins of an ancient palace complex, built during the reign of King Kasyapa (477AD – 495 AD) and surrounding rock is the Royal Garden. It is one of the 7 world heritage sites in Sri Lanka and is one of it’s most popular tourist destinations."
A really lovely ruins to explore. Nice to climb the rock though it does get very busy mid-morning to lunch time.
"This is one place you have to visit if you visit Sri Lanka. 1202 steps up and 1202 steps down and built for the King many, many years ago. "
A very big walk to the top of the rock. Has great history and views from the top. Would recommend doing this early in the morning or late in the afternoon as it gets VERY hot.
We both very much enjoyed our tour and walk up sigria. The lions paw staircase is not for the faint hearted but it's well worth it. You can see exactly why it's a national heritage site as it's just incredible to walk around. Excellent day out with breathtaking views
"Be prepared to walk a lot and climb up stairs. Comfy shoes are must. Not sure if it's the weather or not. You may get wet while climbing up some stairs, water just coming down from the top. Amazing to build a fort like this!"
"This is quite a climb. The easy part below Lions gate is really challenging but once you're there, keep going. It's worth the climb. Going down was so much easier."
We climbed this as part of our trip a deal package and I would have to say it was the highlight of our trip. Some of the others on our tour struggled a bit but there were plenty of people that were willing to assist for a small tip. We did not find the climb too hard and we are 50 & 55 years old.
"The whole experience is unbelievable, especially when you reach the top. The view of the surrounding countryside was unbelievable."
We were thinking a bit about spending or not spending 30$ for entrance fee but after quick thinking we just went there and it was absolutely worth it. You start with walking around small water garden until the steps start. We went there by noon and even though most tours go there very early we just got us a tuktuk-driver from dambulla who dropped us there at 11:00 am. The hike up was quite easy and I was actually a little surprised how quick we were at the top. But the view and the ancient building and architecture was definitely impressive. The only thing not too spectacular were the wall paintings. 
"Definitively not to be missed. The climb was well worth it, the view spectacular and incredible as to how the palace was built."
Amazing place to visit. The climb was quite hectic.. but it was totally worth it.There are multiple stops along the way to take some great photos.So much of history and ancient ingenuity can be seen here. Would suggest going later in the day closer to sunset as the view is breathtaking
"A must when staying at Sigiriya. I am super scared of heights but was so proud that I got to the Lions Paws. Up until this point the stairs are solid, so with support you too can get there. I didn't go up the spiral staircase the frescôes, but saw what I needed to see. I sat and enjoyed the view while the rest of my friends walked to the top. We went early to avoid crowds. Was so worth going."
"The climb took about an hour - up stairways, walkways and a spiral staircase. The view from the top is beautiful - what an amazing place to build a royal fortress. The cost to enter was $30 for foreigners. Buy tickets at the museum and shoe them at 3 different ticket check points. Wear takkies to avoid slipping. The gardens, forests, fruit trees and pools must have been amazing in their day."
Probably the best touristic site I have visited whilst in Sri Lanka. Beautiful garden leading up to the rock with its ancient palace right on top of it. Lots of steep stairs before your reach the top but your effort will be rewarded with breathtaking views
"This is not an easy walk, however if you have some level of fitness it is definitely worth it.  Both to see the ancient relics and the magnificent views. It's advisable to go early in the morning to beat the crowds."
"Very well maintained, definitely worth the climb.  Lots of places to stop on the way up, so no need to worry about your level of fitness.  Worth going early to beat the crowds"
Totally worthwhile visit. Highly recommend to anyone travelling through sri Lanka and a must do if you have time
The climb up sigrigia was well worth the effort.  My mind boggles how all the structures on top of sigrigia could be erected.  Stunning views wirh glimpses into the past.
Fascinating place. Such an incredible sight. I’d recommend an early start to get the climb done before the heat really kicks in.
"Given the history behind it is definitely worth climbing it once. But do it early hours or past 3 pm, when the sun is down. Bring your own water bottle at least 1 full litre. Make sure that you take the service of a nice guide and ensure that you finalize the guide fee clearly, like up and down to explaining every bit of end to end for XXXX rupees. The guide rates are wildly varying I heard."
"There is a fees associated with this. For SAARC country members, the fee is LKR 2835 "
"It is amazing place which should be visited. View from the top of the Lion Rock is amazing before you getting here you should take some stuff (water, cap) and you also should be ready to climb a lot of steps. Also if possible take tour in the morning hours or afternoon then weather is not too hot otherwise it would be hard work to reach the top."
"Definitely worth a visit to Victoria and the citadel, it’s a bit of a walk but worth it, made of impressive limestone with great views of Gozo"
It's a rewarding climb! A real challenging experience. Worth the sweat and exhaustion. We're in our seventies yet fit enough to have reached the top and return as well as most of the others. We did it!
Beautiful place. We traveled with two kids. They enjoyed the greenery and the historic place. History of this place was quite interesting. 
We visited this site as a day trip from Negombo.
It was bit of climb but the view at the top was amazing.Take water and Hat with you.Go early in the morning I think open time was 7am as it gets very hot in the noon.
Visit the museum first to understand the history and take your time to go the lotus pool on the way up. Don't rush. It was off peak season so whilst busy not rammed. Just as well as it was quite busy enough for me thank you. The views are fabulous but the water gardens dont need to be raced through so enjoy as you stroll - save you energy for all those steps - memorable visit
This was part of our round trip of Sri Lanka and when looking at the rock from one side it looked like a breeze. I have an absolute fear of heights but from the view I had at the bottom I thought I’d be ok.
"This is a tough climb, especially when you go up the steel flight of steps. Don't look down. Once you reach the top, you can see for miles. The view is unbelievable. The history of this rock is amazing. Just take your time there are over 1000 steps, but so worth the effort. Just a tip once you pass the part were you have your ticket checked, there are men waiting for tourists to guide you and help you go up the steps. They want foreign currency for a tip which I did not have as I left any thing valuable in the car, the guide was not happy with rupees and I was yelled at and told the rupee is rubbish. Otherwise any one can do it."
Great area with the center of attraction being the lion rock.. Definitely worth the long strenuous climb.. Good views of the expanse at every level of the climb. A few photographers at the top may be a bit of an irritation after a long climb. But nothing to take away from the UNESCO heritage site.
"Our guide suggested we got up early and went while it was cooler, which was a great idea, as even at 7am it was still very warm! It took us about an hour and a half, up and down and it was well worth it. The view from the top is beautiful and its really fascinating being up there, we were lucky enough to have our wonderful guide with us who could tell us everything about it"
"There is a climb up which is manageable. Truly beautiful art carved in the rock face. There are many tourists but I am not sure why anyone would be surprised by it. I mean, many travel to Sigiriya to see this site."
Don't miss this incredible site. Go early to avoid the crowds. Wear comfortable shoes. Take your time. Watch the sunset from the top.
Amazing Ancestors in Sri Lanka with King KASHYAPA made this rock to a castle with unbelievable technology
Prepare to walk and hike more than 1000 steps to the top of this UNESCO world heritage site. Amazing to see thousand years ago the king has built his palace sound this big rock and make many of his sergeant to carry him up and down ! A steep climb up and you need lots of leg power to hike and beware of the new hornets that may come to bite you as many tourist there to disturb the bee with loud noise . A good day walk out but as foreigner you need to pay USD30 per entry per pax. May need to hire a resident guide to tell you a story when hike to make sense ! 
It might be the best known place in Sri Lanka - but its still fantastic!
"This may be an unpopular opinion, but I’d suggest backpackers skip this rock altogether for budget’s sake. It’s just not worth the cost. "
"The views are expansive, the many stepped climb worth every one, go early in the morning to miss the crowds & enjoy the summit. A degree of fitness is needed especially the last part, take it slow, drink lots of water & drink in the views from the top then it's quite fast coming back down. "
Worth the climb up many steps.  Dress light & carry rain jacket. Take snack & water.  Visit in morning
"I should start by saying I think we must have chosen the busiest day of the year to visit here as we were in Sigiriya over a festival. The place was heaving the and queues were so long we didn’t even get to go up the rock! Whilst there were signs saying due to volume of traffic you may not make it up we had wrongly assumed that this we was a standard warning, but after waiting 20 minutes in the queue and moving about 10 meters we decided it wasn’t worth it. Luckily the park is lovely and there are places that you can walk around and we still managed to get some good view points of the rock but it would have taken us hours to get to the top. Pidurangala rock is much better as quieter and cheaper, but it is probably still worth a visit."
"Awesome view from the top, Its crowded during public holidays but still was worth the hike! Ticket counters close at 5 PM, so its best if you go in morning or in the evening around 3 PM. Buses and tuks are available, can rely on public transports to get you here. Plenty of lodging and dining options nearby too. "
"Experience the historical ""Lion rock"", with a walk up past the polished copper stone to the see the Frescos.  Then work your way up to the top to see where Kings Lived.

The views are breathtaking and the history is unbelievable."
"The most beautiful views of Sri Lanka from the top of the mountain. Wild nature, beautiful places surrounded by monkeys, awesome birds and small reptiles and a green paradise with the rice fields, pineapple areas and lots of trees."
"The Sigiyira Rock has an intriguing history. The ruins of the fortress atop the Rock and the water garden below leave visitors to ponder the elegant architectural style of this country's ancient civilisation. Climbing the Rock(esp. When it's windy) is quite a thrilling experience itself. The attached museum is also worth a visit both for the background info it provides and also for appreciating the museum's design, though it's refurbishment is rather minimal. "
"A must-see if you're in Sri Lanka. Beautiful view from the top of the Lion Rock. It took me less than 2 hours to complete the trip from the ticket counter, but good to buffer an extra 0.5 - 1 hour for a more relaxing trip. Recommended timing would be early morning or late afternoon (I arrived at 4pm and it wasn't overly crowded)."
"My experience to climb Sigiriya Lion Rock was extremely good. The place surrounding the rock is also breathtaking, they said that June is an off-season month, but it was crowded with locals and internationals. I guess the ticket is overpriced!"
"My daughter and I climbed this today. We went around 8:30am on a Sunday, and there were small queues going up and big ones going down. But the views were spectacular and the ruins made us wonder how on earth they got all the building materials up there. As suggested in the title, I’m not fit and both my daughter and I got colds a couple of days ago, but we still managed to get up and down in 2½ hours with plenty of rests. There was quite a breeze, which kept things bearable. There are a couple of trees at the top, but there isn’t much shade. "
"I enjoyed this climb. We had a guide try to come with us and although he was telling us some interesting information we really did want to do this on our own. It was difficult to stop him. Otherwise, the climb was fun. Steep at times but safe. The view at the top was very very good. "
"If you look at photos of this place in guidebooks, you could be mistaken to believe that the walkways up this magnificent rock are planks of wood and ropes - they are NOT! They are all either stone steps or firm metal walkways with good handrails. That said, I wouldn’t be keen to let small children run free. We are a relatively unfit couple in our 50s and we were up and down in about 1.5 hours without difficulty."
An absolutely stunning World Heritage Site. The best time to visit is very early in the morning to avoid the crowds.
"This is a UNESCO world heritage site. Most suitable time to witness the beauty is early in the morning, because with the brighten sun light temperature increases. Once entered into the top of the rock you can have a 360' view of the surrounding, can witness the beauty of ancient irrigation systems."
This climb was one of the highlights of my trip! Make sure you get there around 730am at the latest so you are climbing before it gets too hot. The climb takes about 30-45 mins on the way up (depending on your pace) and only 15 to get down. It is a mix of stone and metal steps which are not too uneven. 
Sri Lanka is a Country of steps and this site ie the daddy of them all. Due to our age we only made it to the Lions Paw and that was some achievement. Great scenery from above the plains. The only drawback was the pushing and shoving from the thousand other trying to do the climb also. The Museum at the beginning was also worthwhile. 
"The climb up is steep, but the views are breath taking. The cave paintings are fragile, but beautiful. Hang on to the steel hand rail, but a hat may blow away in the wing on the way up. The mirror wall is truly reflective, both physically and emotionally."
"if you wanna go to the top of the rock, this is the only way possible :) the site is included many old and mysterious monuments and it takes less than one hour to visit. sit has no extra cost ... enjoy it :)"
"Tips for tour guide: If you want to know about everything there from entrance to the first step of the rock and after that to the top of that, it costs only 1500 Rs. Worth it :)"
Half a km walk  to the rock and then a 45 min climb to the top.Reasonable fitness needed to climb comfortably. No refreshments along the way up so carry enough water. Beautiful history and well maintained World Heritage Site !!
Its supposedly 2000 odd steps...But honestly we didnt find it that tough.Its about a half a km walk to the Rock from the Parking area with a small musuem area at the entry point where u purchase tickets. SAARC Country passport holders get a 50% discount on the Adult ticket -- so we paid 15USD each. Child ticket is anyways 15USD. The actual climb is steps all the way to the top with one break area in between where u can rest. The top is a large area and has panoramic views of the entire region with Green forest cover and smaller peaks of the hilly region around. The Rock is clean and well managed. We spent about 3 hours from start to finish.Small street shopping area at the Foreigners Car Park at the exit where u can buy refreshments. It was a good climb and a nice experience. My 10 and 14yr olds did it easily. Anyone with reasonable fitness will not have trouble reaching the top.
This is a must do attraction when in the Sigiriya area.There is a wonderful story attached to the history of this monolith and the countryside and climb are certainly worth the climb (it's not too arduous if you have a reasonable level of fitness). Take your time to the surrounding scenery as you ascend for the ultimate reward at the top.
This is one the best spots that Srilanka can offer!
"You'll walk through a load of old ruins to get to the main attraction which is Sigiriya Rock. The ruins themselves are not particularly impressive. Very overpriced for tourists, but you have to pay to climb the rock and it also gets you through the museum."
This landmark is definitely worth the visit. The climb up is very good and safe. Approx 1200 steps but it didn't seem too bad. You can see some ancient paintings along the way and get the classic photo at the lion staircase. The ruins on the top are cool but the view is what makes it spectacular. Definitely start early before it gets too hot and busy.
"After travelling extensively across Sri Lanka, I went ti Sirigiya rock and I think you can't skip it if visiting the country. It's an impressive site."
We visited this earlish morning it is magnificent our guide was great told us lots about it you don't really realise you're climbing the steps at first we reached half way and one of our party couldn't make it further but we continued up to the feet about three quarters of away up but once we reached that far we were determined to reach the top the views are amazing the last steps aren't at all frightening as I thought they would be and the view was absolutely worth the climb it takes about hour and half a must see 
"Amazing journey climbing up this 500M monument of over 1,600 years old, the journey will take few hours up so make sure you have enough water and a small snack to give you an energy boost on the way, also if you're hiking noonish have a scarf with you, you could get sun burnt without noticing, sun is strong even though on cloudy monsoon days, keep a long sleeve also for it gets very windy as you hike up."
"This rocky outcrop topped with palace ruins is a unique and special Sri Lankan attraction. The most important detail I can offer is how to fit this in to your travel schedule. If you are heading north from the hills (Ella, Haputale etc.) take the train from there to Kandy, then the bus to Dambulla, then change there to another bus to Sigiriya. This is a time-consuming journey, so stay at a hotel in Sigiriya for the night. In the morning, visit the Sigiriya site in the morning for about three hours. Afterwards, take a local bus from Sigiriya southwards to Inamaluwa and get another local bus from there north to Trincomalee. The local bus network in Sri Lanka is extensive and they generally run approx. every 30mins."
"This was a beautiful site to see. I’m glad we went on an overcast day or it would have been extremely hot. Still, wear a hat and take water with you. I can’t say how many steps as everyone says a different number and I didn’t count them. It was a great leg workout. Enjoy, definitely a site to see. "
We were on our honeymoon and we stayed at Sigiriya. Early in the morning our driver took us to the base and we purchased the tickets . For SAARC countries there is also a discount as well. So people belonging to SAARC to countries can also avail this discount. It is recommended to climb the rock in the morning time as the weather is a little pleasant .Before the climb do take some water and if possible chocolates etc as well.Form the near by market we bought up some pineapples as well. The view from the top is too beautiful . And its totally safe to climb up there are a lot of spots where one can rest up.

"We did it,1202 steps to the top in the heat,we were so proud but it was well worth it."
We arrived about 7.30 am and there were already lots of people there! It is definitely worth getting there early as it is cooler and less crowds. We came down about 9am and it was very hot and very crowded.
Arrived around 9am with a guide. Lots of people but did not feel crowded. The grounds before the actual climb are magnificent and the history is fascinating. The entire climb around and up to the top is not too difficult. My husband has bad knees and managed most of the climb missing the last push to the top. There were people clearly nervous about heights and having to push themselves to the top but it is very achievable. Yes it was hot but only what we expected and manageable. This magnificent palace is carved out of granite and is truely something you will not want to miss. A must do.
"Sigiriya is the home of Lion Rock, a 200 m high rock and the site of a 5th-century palace and kingdom. Formed out of the magma of an extinct volcano, King Kasyapa chose the rock as a site for his palace and indeed his own kingdom. ﻿﻿The ancient rock palace has some very unique frescoes that are incredibly well-preserved considering they are more than 1,500 years old and at the plateau, you will find the beautiful gardens of Sigiriya, which are among the oldest landscaped gardens in the world."
There are no words for this place.  Only suggestion is to look at what the palace looked like before so when there you can use your imagination.
"Just as well we left at 7am in the morning, the steeps were fairly steep so not for the faint hearted.  Well worth being at the top but exhausting getting there."
This was a great experience and definitely worth doing. The views were spectacular and the history of Sigiriya is so interesting.
"We arrived at the museum at 07:00 as it opened to purchase tickets. We then went straight to the complex and started the climb to the summit. It was incredible, but I am scared of heights and it really pushed me. Everything was well coordinated and staffed. After exploring the summit we came back down and explored the rest of the ruins, then went to the museum which was very informative. "
We managed to do the hike and it took us about 45 minutes to reach the top. Lots of Tourist come here to visit the Sigiriya. There is a fee that needs to be paid at the entrance. We didn't take the tour guides but just followed the trail on the map provided. If you are a person that is afraid of height dont go there.
"The ancient city of Sigiriya was top of my list for things to do in Sri Lanka and maybe because of the expectation I was perhaps a little dissapointed by the hoardes of people visting, even first thing in the morning. That said, its still a five star and a must see in Sri Lanka and despite the steep entrance fee."
"This is a beautiful place. If you want to go to the top of this old fortress you have to climb over 1000 stepts.It`s not that hard, but it is very hot outside, so try and go early in the moring of at evening to see the sunset. And also, there are a lot of monkeys up there."
We visited early in the morning to avoid the heat. 
"We visited on a hot & humid morning and along with our allocated guide, were soon joined by another guide who offered to help my wife up the stairs. This was appreciated at the time as my wife was struggling with a painful knee. The experience is well worth the effort & the information provided by our guide was valuable in appreciating the site. Once at the top we thanked the second guide & offered him a 500 rupee tip. He said this was not acceptable and demanded a 2000 rupee tip. After returning to the bottom I offered our second guide a 2000 rupee tip but he said 3000 was his price. We never paid this much in tips any where else during our 2 weeks in Sri Lanka & found the guides at the Ancient Rock to be greedy & rude. Be sure to negotiate the tip before your tour starts."
"Yes, the view is great, there's a lion paw and some brick walls on the top. You need to try hard to imagine what those buildings could be once. Why is the mirror wall is called mirror??? It is just a yellow painted wall. Overall, it does not worth usd 30. Go to next hill Pidurangala for lkr 500. It's just too expensive for what you get."
Excellent plea wonderful UNESCO died and good view I'm recommend sigrya rook    good people waking buteful images
"The best ancient experience how a king has lived inside a Huge Massive Rock with all the Srilankan Paintings inside,
Really enjoyed visiting the World Unesco Heritage Site in Srilanka"
We climbed Lion Rock in the early morning (7 am) which was a good idea as the heat can be very taxing. I am 75 and have had coronary artery stents 12 months ago. The trail up was reasonably steep with many steps but many rest areas possible. When we reached the staging area for the ladders (the Lion’s paw) I was surprised that we were so close to the summit. The ladders are steep but safe. However if you are scared of heights do not do the final section as there is a shear drop that looks startling. Great views from the top and fascinating ruins. 
"Amazing history, paintings, architecture, techniques and view. Great place for every travelers who are able to climb. Other can wait down."
"As a lot of tour company’s seem to have cancelled their tours, there weren’t many people at Sigiriya when we climbed in the afternoon, maybe 20 people. Make sure you have time to explore the grounds after you climb by following the signs that go to the car park. We found that more interesting than the actual climb. It’s a beautiful area. When we came down there weren’t any tuk tuks around (perhaps a sign of less tourists) so we walked to our nearby hotel (beware of snakes and elephants if you have to do the same)."
Being 65 with arthritic knees I found going down to be more difficult that going up. It was 32 degrees with high humidity so that added to the degree of difficulty. However if you take your time and keep your fluids up it is certainly achievable. There are some grand views going up and the view from the top is magnificent. If it is physically possible for you to do the climb then do it.
"It was good, the best time to visit Sigiriya is as early as 6.30 am, when the sun is not hot & before the big local crowds come in or in the evening around 3.00 pm when the sin is going down."
Magical place. A very beautiful view from the hill. I recommend going Up. One of many obligatory places on Ceylon.
"Everybody tried to put us off climbing to the top. All the advice was that we should do it only in the early morning and when it wasn't so crowded. Needless to say we didn't have any choice as we were there at midday on a public holiday. It was hot, crowded and difficult (I found the first bit up the stone steps much harder than the bit after the Lions Paws where at least there was a handrail), but it was worth all the effort. Magnificent views!! Just don't believe that the local people are going to be polite and queue quietly. They push and shove you all the way and cut you up when they get the chance. They even tread on you to get in front. But there's never any rancour and they do it with a smile - and they don't seem to mind if you push and shove right back. In fact, be wary of anyone who extends a helping hand. They want money!"
"Must go of Sigiriya!
Very hot and very crowdy, you should go early in a morning
Dont forget to bring your water to the top
Stay away from the cheeky monkies :-)"
"Lots of beautiful nature. Climbing up is not easy, but I think it is possible to reach the top of every person. The most important thing is not to rush. We are not fast, just a little bit rested. The most important thing is to have water. Beautiful panoramic views can be seen from the top. From the top of the hill we landed down quickly, as it was easy to get down."
I arrived relatively early around 8:30am and purchased a ticket there. There weren’t any queues really which was great. I did this on my own with no guide and really enjoyed it. I do think a guide may have given me a bit more knowledge of the place though. It was busy and the climb was hot! The views are absolutely out of this world. I would highly recommend this experience if you are in srilanka.
Worth getting up early to do this climb both for the heat and for the number of people passing on the staircase going up the side of the rock. I'd prepared myself for a much longer climb but reached the top quicker than i thought. We had a guide who told us some interesting information but it's not necessary. The views in all directions are spectacular. We left our hotel at 6am and were back having breakfast by 9.30. Lots of savvy monkeys around so hang on to your valuables!
It is a beautiful site initially approaching the rock through the ponds. You can imagine what it was like when the empire was at its heights. Once you reach the base of the rock its then a easy walk up the the wall of mirrors. Once you reach the Lion's Paw there is a plateau where you get some fantastic views and a good rest stop - then its a vertical stair climb up to the top of the rock. This was the toughest part mainly due to the heat and crowds (it was mid morning) Once you reach the top of the rock you are rewarded with a beautiful view of the surrounding area - well worth the climb up!
"Amazing experience, worth the climb. So much history in this area. Enjoyed the museum tour before to explain the site and its history and significance for Sri Lanka."
In title itself I mentioned both sides of the place.
Just do it. Get over the height and climb to see one of the great sights. Either the build was genius or folly but either way amazing
"I have recently visited sigiriya rock. It was impressive with lots of things to see (gardens, caves etc), however I feel the toughness of the climb gets played down slightly. The steps really are tough, especially the last section. I am great with heights and even I was starting to get a bit wobbly towards the top. When you get to the top the views are worth it. We set off early and got there about 8.15, by the time we got to the top it was 35 degrees and only 9.30 in the morning. I would suggest going as early as possible to avoid the heat and crowds. The crowds were fine at the time we went. One final thing. At the lion feet location, if you decide not to proceed to the top there is an open area with water to wait. This area seemed quite busy (people"
"The other being the Blue Whale we saw, so this is a high bar! Physically beautiful and historically fascinating must-see. Recommend visiting very early in the morning - it is worth an early wake-up to get to the top with a handful of people and not have to snake up the steep stairs with an endless crowd in the hot sun."
Our guide did tell us that to climb the rock in the morning is easier but it's busier as more tourists do the morning climb.
Its a must visit place in Sri Lanka. It is also UNESCO's world heritage site. Once you go there you should climb to the top as the views on the way is amazing seeing all beautiful nature and amazing Sri Lanka. Please take water with you and also try to go in the morning.
"The rock fortress, Ancient City of Sigiriya, is not only iconic because it is UNESCO heritage, but also because of its beautiful history. If you get a chance do read about King Visthavasa and his empire. The frescos that adorn the walls and the architecture are still considered a marvel. "
One of the best in Sri Lanka. I invite ppls to visit this place if not visited. And also make sure you go early  in the morning  so that sun will not be an issue at all.
"We got up early to climb Lion Rock and we're very glad we did! Although we arrived a little late because of an elephant-in-the-road situation! A lovely array of gardens and ponds flank the path that leads towards the start of the walk. There are quite a few stairs, so I'd probably recommend decent shoes - but it wasn't as hard as we were expecting. Doing it early meant that the majority of the path up the rock was in it's shade. Great views of the surrounding area at the top,but not much shade so you can't spend more than about 30 mins there. "
"I was in Sri Lanka for 15 days. I took an early morning bus from Kandy bus station to Dam bulla. I then took another public bus from Dam bulla main bus station to Sigiriya. The bus fare is only 40 rupees. The bus conductor was kind enough to alert me when the bus arrived at the town nearest to the Sigiriya Lion Rock. From this town, it was about 15 mins walk away from the entrance of the attraction. "
"Comparatively it’s an expensive excursion ($30/pp) but it was really cool to see and learn more about the history. The hike up is quite tough, and we did it in the middle of the day (which I do not recommend!). Best to go for early morning or later on for sunset (unsure of how late you can go up). The views from the top are amazing, and the ruins are interesting to walk around."
"An impressive rock on which there used to be the king’s palace built in the 5th century. Now there are only foundations of these buildings left. Metal walkways are steep and narrow, which might be a challenge for somebody. It’s definitely worth to climb on the top of the rock, as the view is amazing, although in a hot day it’s not an easy walk."
All About Sri Lanka travel crew has hosted more than 1000+ happy travelers in the past 15+ years and Sigiriya is one of the best attractions for every traveler. This is a true marvel of ancient Sri Lanka and it resembles the rich culture and history that goes back to thousands of years.
"This is the highlight of our Sigiriya visit. Our chauffeur guide started us early at 630 am. When we arrived at the ticket office there was already a short queue. Each foreign adult ticket cost LKR5,310/- or USD30/-. We skipped the museum and headed straight for the walk up the rock. Our chauffeur guide could not walk up with us as only licensed guide for the Sigiriya is allowed to conduct guided tour there, but he showed us the way. It was quite easy to follow the path as many people were walking the same way. You can engage a licensed guide inside the Sigiriya, we were approached by one but didn’t ask much about how much it costs etc. The climb was quite steep at some points but the steps and railings helped a lot. It was good that we started early so the weather was not too hot and the pace was faster as there was no human jam. The views along the walk up, down and on top of the rock were spectacular. There were 3 rounds of ticket checking - first at the entrance towards the walk up, second at the mid way and third just before walking up the spiral staircase to view the paintings on the wall. We enjoyed Sigiriya very much! We were back on ground at visitors’ car park at about 8 am, just the right time for breakfast!"
"Go early to avoid the heat, and make sure to bring lots of water.  The view from the top is amazing!  The climb took about 45 minutes each way."
You must go early to this place and get your guide to have entry tickets before you get there (ticket office opens 06.45) 
Sigiriya rock is by far the best thing I've seen in Sri Lanka. It has been declared as the 8th wonder of the world by UNESCO and has a rich history associated with it. 
"A mix of Ramayana and Buddhism. That would best describe this place. This is one of the places, where Lord Buddha actually visited. This is a world heritage site. The climb is a must to the top and the view is breathtaking. almost every stone has a story and ensure that you have a good guide to appreciate the relevance to Ramayana. The place has some interesting sign boards (see photo attached). Don't let it deter you. It is worth the climb"
"There are many steps to climb just to get to the Lions Paw the a steep stairs to the top. A good level of fitness is required to get to the top. A Hat sunscreen and plenty of water is essential. The site at the top is surprisingly large. Care needs to be taken because of uneven ground and steps. A very interesting site for those able to get there. Views are wonderful. Watch out for unauthorised guides, There are no facilities once in the site so be prepared."
"It’s a must to do whilst in Sri Lanka. We stayed a stone throw away, so saw it each day at breakfast. It was a challenging hike to the top but worth the effort, even though it was hot at the top... it’s advisable to take a hat and wear sun screen. We had an amazing tour guide, so he informed us of the history and information throughout, which was helpful. "
"Go VERY early, it opens at 6 30 and you want to be one of he first up Less people and a more comfortable climb. A reasonable level of fitness and a good head for heights essential in parts."
"A steep climb up narrow steps following a steady line of visitors of all ages and ability - so thankful for the metal hand railing. At the top, a cool breeze, the ruins of a 5th-century palace and city, and a panoramic view of the plateau below. Largely the ruins are just foundations, there are a few standing walls. There are no services once you are inside the site so make sure you bring some drinking water; there isnt' any shade and the sun was hot (February). If you are bothered by heights you might find the ascent challenging. Monkeys lounge on the walls, scanning for signs of food, if you bring any food be careful; we saw a lady who was bitten trying to hold onto her snack from a thieving monkey."
"For me, in my opinion, I don’t think it was that great. There’s nothing up there and the way to go was a single track which you have to stucked with a lot of people. I prefer Pidurangala Rock but if you visit Sigiriya, go both rocks!"
"This is a fortress and ancient city which if you are there in Sigiriya, do visit. Be prepared for a little hike, with lots of stairs to climb, spiralling stairs, steep stairs, tiny stairs etc. But it's worth the walk and a little activity. Don't miss out the heritage site..."
We visited Sigiriya early morning - I think this was a wise choice by our guide due to the heat - Sigiriya is stunning and worth a visit but if you don’t like heights / small staircases on the side of a massive rock then this is not for you. The view from the top is amazing but getting there is hard work - we visited with children aged 6 and 10 and they loved the views but they had plenty of of questions of how / why / when etc and lucky for us the guide had the answers. 
"Sigiriya Lion's Rock is one of the best and famous attraction in Sri Lanka. If you are young and fit you should do this activity. It was so fun to Climb, There was so much to learn about history and technology used here. It was rainy day but it was not a big issue for us. It was fun, we enjoyed the rain. It's worth climb to see beautiful view from top of the Sigiriya. AMAZING! "
"I truly enjoyed climbing Sigiriya Rock. Got there early, and we were on our way at about 6:40 am. It’s hot here in April, so there was some serious sweating involved, but it’s not a huge hike really. Bring some water. Also we had our guide / driver with us who always has all the important stories to explain a place - really a great value add, considering there is just some rubble. I thought the entrance fee for a family of four, in excess of USD 100, quite steep, but I am glad we did it. "
"The earlier the better to beat the heat and the crowd. The entrance fee is 5310 rupee for foreigners, which is kind of pricy. It also includes Sigiriya museum that is in the same building of the ticket counter. "
"A big respect to my wife, she had fractured her ankle not long before we travelled but she made it to the top. What a climb !!!! If you are contemplating going make sure you go early in the morning otherwise the crowds are enormous, and take a bottle of water. Boots are not needed but trainers will suffice. Take your camera, excellent views from the top. Well worth a visit."
My daughter and I visited the rock at 630 in the morning. The weather is perfect for walking the rock at this time. 
"It's not just a climb up the rock but has an interesting history behind it. The climb it self was exhausting but with the short stops it helped us gain some breath. Once you reach the top, you totally forget the climb the views are just incredible. Would recommend this to everyone with a healthy heart."
My advice... do it in the morning before it gets too hot. There are steps to be climbed and it could be a challenge. Having said that it is really worth it just to be impressed with the human ingenuity that constructed such a temple. The view from the top is impressive. The frescoes that remain on the rock walls are stunning (note no photography allowed). The area is overall impressively maintained right down to the removal of the plastic wrapping from your drink bottle at the checkpoint. Your bags are also checked for any other plastic materials that could contaminate the site. A model other countries could follow. The stair case is quite safe though I can see it can become busy. The signs for hornets is advisory and definitely not an issue for us. Get there when the park opens to avoid the crowds. Certainly worth the climb. 
We were very excited to visit .. and more excited about the climb with my 6 year old. but trust me the journey was nice but the destination was not even worth the walk..
The ancient city was one of our favorite stops on our trip. The climb to the top of the rock is long but worth it. The view is incredible once you reach the top.
"What an experience it is to climb the rock. Our driver advised us to do it later in the afternoon to avoid the hottest part of the day but nevertheless, it was still nearly 30° when we climbed around 4pm. That said, it was worth it! It wasn’t as busy as some have said in previous reviews, although there were many people, we didn’t have to wait in long queues going up or down. Just the occasional pause to catch your breath and off you go again while others around you do the same. "
This area is fascinating. The museum gives a great insight into the achievements needed to creat a town on top of this rock thousands of years ago.
"Having spent 2 weeks travelling around Sri Lanka, Ella and Sigiriya had their own charms. Sigirya has alot more wildlife to offer. Many will also argue that 5000 rupees to climb the Lion's Rock is too expensive; which it is. However, if you are coming to Sigiriya then climbing the 2 large rocks is something that just has to be done! There are many steps but it is more straightforward than Pidurangala rock - just be aware that their are monkeys nearer to the top who will want to get into your backpacks!"
"We climbed the rock and where not let down, it’s best to have a guide so they can show you things and explain the history. We left our hotel at 6.10am to get to the rock as early as possible ! This was for two reasons to miss the majority of the other tourists and also to do it at the coolest time , I can highly recommend this as it a tough ascent and it gets hot an sweaty. The pain was well worth the it the view was stunning "
"I highly recommend bringing the exact amount of money you need to enter. The price is $35/person, and I dont recommend paying in their local currency as it fluctuates too much from day to day. "
"It was wonderful 
So I’m here at sri lanka together with my local boyfriend and he bring me to sigiriya and it’s was so worth it. It was so amazing as you can see all the ancients scribble and  rock formation. 

Nature is life"
We climbed it yesterday: went OK.
text
"We did it,1202 steps to the top in the heat,we were so proud but it was well worth it."
We arrived about 7.30 am and there were already lots of people there! It is definitely worth getting there early as it is cooler and less crowds. We came down about 9am and it was very hot and very crowded.
Arrived around 9am with a guide. Lots of people but did not feel crowded. The grounds before the actual climb are magnificent and the history is fascinating. The entire climb around and up to the top is not too difficult. My husband has bad knees and managed most of the climb missing the last push to the top. There were people clearly nervous about heights and having to push themselves to the top but it is very achievable. Yes it was hot but only what we expected and manageable. This magnificent palace is carved out of granite and is truely something you will not want to miss. A must do.
"Sigiriya is the home of Lion Rock, a 200 m high rock and the site of a 5th-century palace and kingdom. Formed out of the magma of an extinct volcano, King Kasyapa chose the rock as a site for his palace and indeed his own kingdom. ﻿﻿The ancient rock palace has some very unique frescoes that are incredibly well-preserved considering they are more than 1,500 years old and at the plateau, you will find the beautiful gardens of Sigiriya, which are among the oldest landscaped gardens in the world."
There are no words for this place.  Only suggestion is to look at what the palace looked like before so when there you can use your imagination.
"Just as well we left at 7am in the morning, the steeps were fairly steep so not for the faint hearted.  Well worth being at the top but exhausting getting there."
This was a great experience and definitely worth doing. The views were spectacular and the history of Sigiriya is so interesting.
"We arrived at the museum at 07:00 as it opened to purchase tickets. We then went straight to the complex and started the climb to the summit. It was incredible, but I am scared of heights and it really pushed me. Everything was well coordinated and staffed. After exploring the summit we came back down and explored the rest of the ruins, then went to the museum which was very informative. "
We managed to do the hike and it took us about 45 minutes to reach the top. Lots of Tourist come here to visit the Sigiriya. There is a fee that needs to be paid at the entrance. We didn't take the tour guides but just followed the trail on the map provided. If you are a person that is afraid of height dont go there.
"The ancient city of Sigiriya was top of my list for things to do in Sri Lanka and maybe because of the expectation I was perhaps a little dissapointed by the hoardes of people visting, even first thing in the morning. That said, its still a five star and a must see in Sri Lanka and despite the steep entrance fee."
"This is a beautiful place. If you want to go to the top of this old fortress you have to climb over 1000 stepts.It`s not that hard, but it is very hot outside, so try and go early in the moring of at evening to see the sunset. And also, there are a lot of monkeys up there."
We visited early in the morning to avoid the heat. 
"We visited on a hot & humid morning and along with our allocated guide, were soon joined by another guide who offered to help my wife up the stairs. This was appreciated at the time as my wife was struggling with a painful knee. The experience is well worth the effort & the information provided by our guide was valuable in appreciating the site. Once at the top we thanked the second guide & offered him a 500 rupee tip. He said this was not acceptable and demanded a 2000 rupee tip. After returning to the bottom I offered our second guide a 2000 rupee tip but he said 3000 was his price. We never paid this much in tips any where else during our 2 weeks in Sri Lanka & found the guides at the Ancient Rock to be greedy & rude. Be sure to negotiate the tip before your tour starts."
"Yes, the view is great, there's a lion paw and some brick walls on the top. You need to try hard to imagine what those buildings could be once. Why is the mirror wall is called mirror??? It is just a yellow painted wall. Overall, it does not worth usd 30. Go to next hill Pidurangala for lkr 500. It's just too expensive for what you get."
Excellent plea wonderful UNESCO died and good view I'm recommend sigrya rook    good people waking buteful images
"The best ancient experience how a king has lived inside a Huge Massive Rock with all the Srilankan Paintings inside,
Really enjoyed visiting the World Unesco Heritage Site in Srilanka"
We climbed Lion Rock in the early morning (7 am) which was a good idea as the heat can be very taxing. I am 75 and have had coronary artery stents 12 months ago. The trail up was reasonably steep with many steps but many rest areas possible. When we reached the staging area for the ladders (the Lion’s paw) I was surprised that we were so close to the summit. The ladders are steep but safe. However if you are scared of heights do not do the final section as there is a shear drop that looks startling. Great views from the top and fascinating ruins. 
"Amazing history, paintings, architecture, techniques and view. Great place for every travelers who are able to climb. Other can wait down."
"As a lot of tour company’s seem to have cancelled their tours, there weren’t many people at Sigiriya when we climbed in the afternoon, maybe 20 people. Make sure you have time to explore the grounds after you climb by following the signs that go to the car park. We found that more interesting than the actual climb. It’s a beautiful area. When we came down there weren’t any tuk tuks around (perhaps a sign of less tourists) so we walked to our nearby hotel (beware of snakes and elephants if you have to do the same)."
Being 65 with arthritic knees I found going down to be more difficult that going up. It was 32 degrees with high humidity so that added to the degree of difficulty. However if you take your time and keep your fluids up it is certainly achievable. There are some grand views going up and the view from the top is magnificent. If it is physically possible for you to do the climb then do it.
"It was good, the best time to visit Sigiriya is as early as 6.30 am, when the sun is not hot & before the big local crowds come in or in the evening around 3.00 pm when the sin is going down."
Magical place. A very beautiful view from the hill. I recommend going Up. One of many obligatory places on Ceylon.
"Everybody tried to put us off climbing to the top. All the advice was that we should do it only in the early morning and when it wasn't so crowded. Needless to say we didn't have any choice as we were there at midday on a public holiday. It was hot, crowded and difficult (I found the first bit up the stone steps much harder than the bit after the Lions Paws where at least there was a handrail), but it was worth all the effort. Magnificent views!! Just don't believe that the local people are going to be polite and queue quietly. They push and shove you all the way and cut you up when they get the chance. They even tread on you to get in front. But there's never any rancour and they do it with a smile - and they don't seem to mind if you push and shove right back. In fact, be wary of anyone who extends a helping hand. They want money!"
"Must go of Sigiriya!
Very hot and very crowdy, you should go early in a morning
Dont forget to bring your water to the top
Stay away from the cheeky monkies :-)"
"Lots of beautiful nature. Climbing up is not easy, but I think it is possible to reach the top of every person. The most important thing is not to rush. We are not fast, just a little bit rested. The most important thing is to have water. Beautiful panoramic views can be seen from the top. From the top of the hill we landed down quickly, as it was easy to get down."
I arrived relatively early around 8:30am and purchased a ticket there. There weren’t any queues really which was great. I did this on my own with no guide and really enjoyed it. I do think a guide may have given me a bit more knowledge of the place though. It was busy and the climb was hot! The views are absolutely out of this world. I would highly recommend this experience if you are in srilanka.
Worth getting up early to do this climb both for the heat and for the number of people passing on the staircase going up the side of the rock. I'd prepared myself for a much longer climb but reached the top quicker than i thought. We had a guide who told us some interesting information but it's not necessary. The views in all directions are spectacular. We left our hotel at 6am and were back having breakfast by 9.30. Lots of savvy monkeys around so hang on to your valuables!
It is a beautiful site initially approaching the rock through the ponds. You can imagine what it was like when the empire was at its heights. Once you reach the base of the rock its then a easy walk up the the wall of mirrors. Once you reach the Lion's Paw there is a plateau where you get some fantastic views and a good rest stop - then its a vertical stair climb up to the top of the rock. This was the toughest part mainly due to the heat and crowds (it was mid morning) Once you reach the top of the rock you are rewarded with a beautiful view of the surrounding area - well worth the climb up!
"Amazing experience, worth the climb. So much history in this area. Enjoyed the museum tour before to explain the site and its history and significance for Sri Lanka."
In title itself I mentioned both sides of the place.
Just do it. Get over the height and climb to see one of the great sights. Either the build was genius or folly but either way amazing
"I have recently visited sigiriya rock. It was impressive with lots of things to see (gardens, caves etc), however I feel the toughness of the climb gets played down slightly. The steps really are tough, especially the last section. I am great with heights and even I was starting to get a bit wobbly towards the top. When you get to the top the views are worth it. We set off early and got there about 8.15, by the time we got to the top it was 35 degrees and only 9.30 in the morning. I would suggest going as early as possible to avoid the heat and crowds. The crowds were fine at the time we went. One final thing. At the lion feet location, if you decide not to proceed to the top there is an open area with water to wait. This area seemed quite busy (people"
"The other being the Blue Whale we saw, so this is a high bar! Physically beautiful and historically fascinating must-see. Recommend visiting very early in the morning - it is worth an early wake-up to get to the top with a handful of people and not have to snake up the steep stairs with an endless crowd in the hot sun."
Our guide did tell us that to climb the rock in the morning is easier but it's busier as more tourists do the morning climb.
Its a must visit place in Sri Lanka. It is also UNESCO's world heritage site. Once you go there you should climb to the top as the views on the way is amazing seeing all beautiful nature and amazing Sri Lanka. Please take water with you and also try to go in the morning.
"The rock fortress, Ancient City of Sigiriya, is not only iconic because it is UNESCO heritage, but also because of its beautiful history. If you get a chance do read about King Visthavasa and his empire. The frescos that adorn the walls and the architecture are still considered a marvel. "
One of the best in Sri Lanka. I invite ppls to visit this place if not visited. And also make sure you go early  in the morning  so that sun will not be an issue at all.
"We got up early to climb Lion Rock and we're very glad we did! Although we arrived a little late because of an elephant-in-the-road situation! A lovely array of gardens and ponds flank the path that leads towards the start of the walk. There are quite a few stairs, so I'd probably recommend decent shoes - but it wasn't as hard as we were expecting. Doing it early meant that the majority of the path up the rock was in it's shade. Great views of the surrounding area at the top,but not much shade so you can't spend more than about 30 mins there. "
"I was in Sri Lanka for 15 days. I took an early morning bus from Kandy bus station to Dam bulla. I then took another public bus from Dam bulla main bus station to Sigiriya. The bus fare is only 40 rupees. The bus conductor was kind enough to alert me when the bus arrived at the town nearest to the Sigiriya Lion Rock. From this town, it was about 15 mins walk away from the entrance of the attraction. "
"Comparatively it’s an expensive excursion ($30/pp) but it was really cool to see and learn more about the history. The hike up is quite tough, and we did it in the middle of the day (which I do not recommend!). Best to go for early morning or later on for sunset (unsure of how late you can go up). The views from the top are amazing, and the ruins are interesting to walk around."
"An impressive rock on which there used to be the king’s palace built in the 5th century. Now there are only foundations of these buildings left. Metal walkways are steep and narrow, which might be a challenge for somebody. It’s definitely worth to climb on the top of the rock, as the view is amazing, although in a hot day it’s not an easy walk."

"We climbed the rock and where not let down, it’s best to have a guide so they can show you things and explain the history. We left our hotel at 6.10am to get to the rock as early as possible ! This was for two reasons to miss the majority of the other tourists and also to do it at the coolest time , I can highly recommend this as it a tough ascent and it gets hot an sweaty. The pain was well worth the it the view was stunning "
"I highly recommend bringing the exact amount of money you need to enter. The price is $35/person, and I dont recommend paying in their local currency as it fluctuates too much from day to day. "
"It was wonderful 
So I’m here at sri lanka together with my local boyfriend and he bring me to sigiriya and it’s was so worth it. It was so amazing as you can see all the ancients scribble and  rock formation. 

Nature is life"
We climbed it yesterday: went OK.
"We left our Sigiriya hotel early to take advantage of the cooler conditions, we drove half an hour to Sigiriya Rock Fortress, a UNESCO site that dates back to the 5th Century when established as a king's palace and fortress. It was later used as a Buddhist Monastery until the 14th Century. "
"We didn't quite make it for 6.30 as we'd hoped, but we had our tickets and were on our way before 7, and it only got crowded when we were on our way down."
"Climbing the rock of Sigiriya is an essential part of a visit to Sri Lanka and possibly the most memorable. It can be crowded and hot but experiencing the climb together with the thousands of Sri Lankan people is not to be missed. Get there early and take plenty of water. A back pack is a good idea to leave hands free as some of the climb is quite steep and exposed, although always robust and safe. There are a lot of steps but it is always crowded so the rate of climb is leisurely and does not feel strenuous for the older person. The climb itself is exciting and breathtaking, but there is also the most stunning cave art after a short stretch up a spiral staircase, and then the view from the top is marvellous."
"This site is huge: much of it is easily accessible at low level - ancient water gardens, fortifications etc. However the focus of the site is the Lion Rock and its fortress. Climbing this will be a challenge for many people. But if you think you are up to it, give it a go. It is mostly stepped, so easy-enough for the able-bodied. The views (even on a misty day) are fabulous. On the summit was a huge fortress evidence of which still remains. "
This is a tremendous site. It is the foundations of an ancient town existing BC. The main attraction is a vertical climb up a rock face to see the foundations of an ancient palace on the top. The climb is just over 1000 steps so you need to be fit and not suffer from vertigo. There are fabulous views and a stopping place two-thirds of the way up if you cannot make it to the top. It is wise to arrive early before 9.00am as it becomes very busy when coach trips arrive.
"This place is full of miracles and I Cant believe I climbed the 1200 plus steps! Such an amazing feeling when you reach the top! its hard to think how it was built at that time. It is a vast area with loads of architectural structures including ponds, Steps, Doors and many more."
The Ancient City of Sigiriya was amazing to see! But... we should have arrived earlier. When we got to the beginning of the path up it was crazy!! There were so many people pushing to get up the stairs. Mant travelers turned around and left to get out the madness. Get there early for less crazy!
I had a voucher so got the first ticket but then with my driver went to the museum which did not open till 8am so when on teh climb. Some tips take water and rest on your way if you can. Im not fit so had to rest on the way and at the top. Wonderful site and later in day returned to see the museum.
Incredible and absolutely worth the cost- as foreigners we should definitely pay more so I do not disagree with this.
The best advice I can give is to get up early and be at the ticket office when it opens at 6.30am
"We are not great explorers! However you cannot go to Sigiriya without giving the rock climb a go. As we discovered, luckily, you don't have to go all the way up but at least get yourself up to the rock paintings and lions feet. Yes it's all quite steep, getting down is harder) but take your time and go early (6:30am) to beat the crowds and heat - we were back at our accommodation nearby by about 8:30. At least you can say you did it!!"
"Finally - a UNESCO site worth the price of admission in Sri Lanka! Somehwat challenging walk - do it in the morning as the rock provides shade for most of the climb. Walk through the well-marked remains of royal gardens on way to the steps and stairs to the top. Once on top, in the midst of a medieval fortress, enjoy 360 degree views. It's a lot easier coming down. Get a pick in front of the Lion's Feet too. Nice breeze on top. Clean (relatively) bathrooms on site."
"The only point is given to the beautiful view of the lion rock, but the management of the site is absolutely TERRIBLE !!! "
My personal opinion is that Lion's rock is both easier and safer compared to Pidurangala. The view on top is amazing but it is primarily the vestiges of an ancient time that are strikingly magnificent.
"I climbed this rock with my two children ages 8 and 4. I was really concerned about the safety. Oh well, the climb is not unsafe at all. All the 1200 steps are well made. Few are bricked and others are metal stairs. They’re fenced as you go up. There are many places in between with shade where you can stop and rest. Its hot no doubt. Carry water and wear sunscreen and hats. Its gets windy as you go up so no worries. "
"Very impressive, but go as early as possible as it is very exposed and hot. We got there at 6.30 when it opens and there were a reasonable number of people there even then. When we were on the top at 8am it was very hot and obviously would be much warmer later in the day. There is little shade on the top."
My wife climbed the rock and as she is a keen rambler said the climb was not difficult at all. Lots of history of the area and well maintained gardens
"One of the highlights of our tour of Sri Lanka. The rock is a 260 metre climb, most of which is via steps on the shaded west side of the rock. "
Climbing sigiriya was one of the best thing I have ever done.It was a challenge.I did walk around the top very much and the view are breathtaking and well worth wobbly knees.It was a great sightseen in srilanka.
"Highlights: First, the walk to the top includes a wall of gorgeous frescoes as well as the incredible lion paw steps. These two stops along the hike make for welcome rest stops, and are really quite amazing! Second, the view from the top is breathtaking, and well worth the climb. Third, the monkeys were really friendly and quite adorable. They kept my spirits high as I began to run out of energy towards the top!"
1000+ steps to climb. It is best to visit early to avoid heat and crowds. View from top is fantastic.
"First of all be careful of large wasp who reside on the top of rock.!!! They attacked the people just after we left the place. few people were hospitalised, I heard. Old king has built the place. It's really worth to climb up and see the ancient paintings and the city ruins. but authorities should pay attention for preserve the paintings, and also the city ruins. Place was overall OK except the site guides on the bottom of rock and the entrance charge for tourist. site guides sometimes really annoying for tourists. someone should do something"
You want to start early as it gets hot and it gets busy. The rock does not look challenging from the base but it is hard work. Take it steady and all will be well.
"If you visited another ancient city in asian country I don’t suggest this place but if you are not it is to be missed. So hot so crowded long way to go up but when you arrive the best part is lion cave. Anything else except some ruined walls and rooms that has not clear information about the time . Elephant rock ,cobra rock shoud not to be missed."
"You need to climb 1200 steps (about 2 hours) to get to the top

No service or shaded areas

Not much to see on top"
"Get up early and get to the rock early before 9am to avoid the heat & crowds. The steep steps and climb to the top are well worth the views and experience .
Take your time going up and look back at the panoramic views!"
"although it can get pretty crowded and it is not a cheap place to visit, still I think that it is worth going there, a lot of climbing to the top compensates the breathtaking view and the remains let you think how it must have looked like in the past in its glory days"
This is an amazing sight to visit. Seen for miles around.If you manage the fairly strenuous walk/climb to the top you will not be disappointed. Its a must if your in this area but make sure you time it right. I climbed at 4.30pm just as it was getting cooler and in time to witness fantastic sunset.
"Is a fortress, high enought to see the neibourhoods. Is a unique senzation that you are on the top of the word, esspecialy because they don't have tall buildings."
With over 1000 steps to climb - of differing types and sizes - this is not for the faint hearted or unfit. You need sturdy shoes and plenty of water. It is best to go very early in the day to avoid crowds and heat. It opens at 7am. It is an amazing site with a lot of history and stunning views from the top.

"A homogenous blend of Ramayana and Buddhism. That would exactly describe this place and the perfect blend of the two cultures or ideally can be said religion. This is one of the places, where Lord Buddha actually visited. This is a world heritage site. The climb is a must to the top and the view is breathtaking. almost every stone has a story and ensure that you have a good guide to appreciate the relevance to Ramayana. Don't let it detour you. It is worth the climb.!!!"
"We did it,1202 steps to the top in the heat,we were so proud but it was well worth it."
We arrived about 7.30 am and there were already lots of people there! It is definitely worth getting there early as it is cooler and less crowds. We came down about 9am and it was very hot and very crowded.
Arrived around 9am with a guide. Lots of people but did not feel crowded. The grounds before the actual climb are magnificent and the history is fascinating. The entire climb around and up to the top is not too difficult. My husband has bad knees and managed most of the climb missing the last push to the top. There were people clearly nervous about heights and having to push themselves to the top but it is very achievable. Yes it was hot but only what we expected and manageable. This magnificent palace is carved out of granite and is truely something you will not want to miss. A must do.
"Sigiriya is the home of Lion Rock, a 200 m high rock and the site of a 5th-century palace and kingdom. Formed out of the magma of an extinct volcano, King Kasyapa chose the rock as a site for his palace and indeed his own kingdom. ﻿﻿The ancient rock palace has some very unique frescoes that are incredibly well-preserved considering they are more than 1,500 years old and at the plateau, you will find the beautiful gardens of Sigiriya, which are among the oldest landscaped gardens in the world."
There are no words for this place.  Only suggestion is to look at what the palace looked like before so when there you can use your imagination.
"Just as well we left at 7am in the morning, the steeps were fairly steep so not for the faint hearted.  Well worth being at the top but exhausting getting there."
This was a great experience and definitely worth doing. The views were spectacular and the history of Sigiriya is so interesting.
"We arrived at the museum at 07:00 as it opened to purchase tickets. We then went straight to the complex and started the climb to the summit. It was incredible, but I am scared of heights and it really pushed me. Everything was well coordinated and staffed. After exploring the summit we came back down and explored the rest of the ruins, then went to the museum which was very informative. "
We managed to do the hike and it took us about 45 minutes to reach the top. Lots of Tourist come here to visit the Sigiriya. There is a fee that needs to be paid at the entrance. We didn't take the tour guides but just followed the trail on the map provided. If you are a person that is afraid of height dont go there.
"The ancient city of Sigiriya was top of my list for things to do in Sri Lanka and maybe because of the expectation I was perhaps a little dissapointed by the hoardes of people visting, even first thing in the morning. That said, its still a five star and a must see in Sri Lanka and despite the steep entrance fee."
"This is a beautiful place. If you want to go to the top of this old fortress you have to climb over 1000 stepts.It`s not that hard, but it is very hot outside, so try and go early in the moring of at evening to see the sunset. And also, there are a lot of monkeys up there."
We visited early in the morning to avoid the heat. 
"We visited on a hot & humid morning and along with our allocated guide, were soon joined by another guide who offered to help my wife up the stairs. This was appreciated at the time as my wife was struggling with a painful knee. The experience is well worth the effort & the information provided by our guide was valuable in appreciating the site. Once at the top we thanked the second guide & offered him a 500 rupee tip. He said this was not acceptable and demanded a 2000 rupee tip. After returning to the bottom I offered our second guide a 2000 rupee tip but he said 3000 was his price. We never paid this much in tips any where else during our 2 weeks in Sri Lanka & found the guides at the Ancient Rock to be greedy & rude. Be sure to negotiate the tip before your tour starts."
"Yes, the view is great, there's a lion paw and some brick walls on the top. You need to try hard to imagine what those buildings could be once. Why is the mirror wall is called mirror??? It is just a yellow painted wall. Overall, it does not worth usd 30. Go to next hill Pidurangala for lkr 500. It's just too expensive for what you get."
Excellent plea wonderful UNESCO died and good view I'm recommend sigrya rook    good people waking buteful images
"The best ancient experience how a king has lived inside a Huge Massive Rock with all the Srilankan Paintings inside,
Really enjoyed visiting the World Unesco Heritage Site in Srilanka"
We climbed Lion Rock in the early morning (7 am) which was a good idea as the heat can be very taxing. I am 75 and have had coronary artery stents 12 months ago. The trail up was reasonably steep with many steps but many rest areas possible. When we reached the staging area for the ladders (the Lion’s paw) I was surprised that we were so close to the summit. The ladders are steep but safe. However if you are scared of heights do not do the final section as there is a shear drop that looks startling. Great views from the top and fascinating ruins. 
"Amazing history, paintings, architecture, techniques and view. Great place for every travelers who are able to climb. Other can wait down."
"As a lot of tour company’s seem to have cancelled their tours, there weren’t many people at Sigiriya when we climbed in the afternoon, maybe 20 people. Make sure you have time to explore the grounds after you climb by following the signs that go to the car park. We found that more interesting than the actual climb. It’s a beautiful area. When we came down there weren’t any tuk tuks around (perhaps a sign of less tourists) so we walked to our nearby hotel (beware of snakes and elephants if you have to do the same)."
Being 65 with arthritic knees I found going down to be more difficult that going up. It was 32 degrees with high humidity so that added to the degree of difficulty. However if you take your time and keep your fluids up it is certainly achievable. There are some grand views going up and the view from the top is magnificent. If it is physically possible for you to do the climb then do it.
"It was good, the best time to visit Sigiriya is as early as 6.30 am, when the sun is not hot & before the big local crowds come in or in the evening around 3.00 pm when the sin is going down."
Magical place. A very beautiful view from the hill. I recommend going Up. One of many obligatory places on Ceylon.
"Everybody tried to put us off climbing to the top. All the advice was that we should do it only in the early morning and when it wasn't so crowded. Needless to say we didn't have any choice as we were there at midday on a public holiday. It was hot, crowded and difficult (I found the first bit up the stone steps much harder than the bit after the Lions Paws where at least there was a handrail), but it was worth all the effort. Magnificent views!! Just don't believe that the local people are going to be polite and queue quietly. They push and shove you all the way and cut you up when they get the chance. They even tread on you to get in front. But there's never any rancour and they do it with a smile - and they don't seem to mind if you push and shove right back. In fact, be wary of anyone who extends a helping hand. They want money!"
"Must go of Sigiriya!
Very hot and very crowdy, you should go early in a morning
Dont forget to bring your water to the top
Stay away from the cheeky monkies :-)"
"Lots of beautiful nature. Climbing up is not easy, but I think it is possible to reach the top of every person. The most important thing is not to rush. We are not fast, just a little bit rested. The most important thing is to have water. Beautiful panoramic views can be seen from the top. From the top of the hill we landed down quickly, as it was easy to get down."
I arrived relatively early around 8:30am and purchased a ticket there. There weren’t any queues really which was great. I did this on my own with no guide and really enjoyed it. I do think a guide may have given me a bit more knowledge of the place though. It was busy and the climb was hot! The views are absolutely out of this world. I would highly recommend this experience if you are in srilanka.
Worth getting up early to do this climb both for the heat and for the number of people passing on the staircase going up the side of the rock. I'd prepared myself for a much longer climb but reached the top quicker than i thought. We had a guide who told us some interesting information but it's not necessary. The views in all directions are spectacular. We left our hotel at 6am and were back having breakfast by 9.30. Lots of savvy monkeys around so hang on to your valuables!
It is a beautiful site initially approaching the rock through the ponds. You can imagine what it was like when the empire was at its heights. Once you reach the base of the rock its then a easy walk up the the wall of mirrors. Once you reach the Lion's Paw there is a plateau where you get some fantastic views and a good rest stop - then its a vertical stair climb up to the top of the rock. This was the toughest part mainly due to the heat and crowds (it was mid morning) Once you reach the top of the rock you are rewarded with a beautiful view of the surrounding area - well worth the climb up!
"Amazing experience, worth the climb. So much history in this area. Enjoyed the museum tour before to explain the site and its history and significance for Sri Lanka."
In title itself I mentioned both sides of the place.
Just do it. Get over the height and climb to see one of the great sights. Either the build was genius or folly but either way amazing
"I have recently visited sigiriya rock. It was impressive with lots of things to see (gardens, caves etc), however I feel the toughness of the climb gets played down slightly. The steps really are tough, especially the last section. I am great with heights and even I was starting to get a bit wobbly towards the top. When you get to the top the views are worth it. We set off early and got there about 8.15, by the time we got to the top it was 35 degrees and only 9.30 in the morning. I would suggest going as early as possible to avoid the heat and crowds. The crowds were fine at the time we went. One final thing. At the lion feet location, if you decide not to proceed to the top there is an open area with water to wait. This area seemed quite busy (people"
"The other being the Blue Whale we saw, so this is a high bar! Physically beautiful and historically fascinating must-see. Recommend visiting very early in the morning - it is worth an early wake-up to get to the top with a handful of people and not have to snake up the steep stairs with an endless crowd in the hot sun."
Our guide did tell us that to climb the rock in the morning is easier but it's busier as more tourists do the morning climb.
Its a must visit place in Sri Lanka. It is also UNESCO's world heritage site. Once you go there you should climb to the top as the views on the way is amazing seeing all beautiful nature and amazing Sri Lanka. Please take water with you and also try to go in the morning.
"The rock fortress, Ancient City of Sigiriya, is not only iconic because it is UNESCO heritage, but also because of its beautiful history. If you get a chance do read about King Visthavasa and his empire. The frescos that adorn the walls and the architecture are still considered a marvel. "
One of the best in Sri Lanka. I invite ppls to visit this place if not visited. And also make sure you go early  in the morning  so that sun will not be an issue at all.
"We got up early to climb Lion Rock and we're very glad we did! Although we arrived a little late because of an elephant-in-the-road situation! A lovely array of gardens and ponds flank the path that leads towards the start of the walk. There are quite a few stairs, so I'd probably recommend decent shoes - but it wasn't as hard as we were expecting. Doing it early meant that the majority of the path up the rock was in it's shade. Great views of the surrounding area at the top,but not much shade so you can't spend more than about 30 mins there. "
"I was in Sri Lanka for 15 days. I took an early morning bus from Kandy bus station to Dam bulla. I then took another public bus from Dam bulla main bus station to Sigiriya. The bus fare is only 40 rupees. The bus conductor was kind enough to alert me when the bus arrived at the town nearest to the Sigiriya Lion Rock. From this town, it was about 15 mins walk away from the entrance of the attraction. "
"Comparatively it’s an expensive excursion ($30/pp) but it was really cool to see and learn more about the history. The hike up is quite tough, and we did it in the middle of the day (which I do not recommend!). Best to go for early morning or later on for sunset (unsure of how late you can go up). The views from the top are amazing, and the ruins are interesting to walk around."
"An impressive rock on which there used to be the king’s palace built in the 5th century. Now there are only foundations of these buildings left. Metal walkways are steep and narrow, which might be a challenge for somebody. It’s definitely worth to climb on the top of the rock, as the view is amazing, although in a hot day it’s not an easy walk."
All About Sri Lanka travel crew has hosted more than 1000+ happy travelers in the past 15+ years and Sigiriya is one of the best attractions for every traveler. This is a true marvel of ancient Sri Lanka and it resembles the rich culture and history that goes back to thousands of years.
"This is the highlight of our Sigiriya visit. Our chauffeur guide started us early at 630 am. When we arrived at the ticket office there was already a short queue. Each foreign adult ticket cost LKR5,310/- or USD30/-. We skipped the museum and headed straight for the walk up the rock. Our chauffeur guide could not walk up with us as only licensed guide for the Sigiriya is allowed to conduct guided tour there, but he showed us the way. It was quite easy to follow the path as many people were walking the same way. You can engage a licensed guide inside the Sigiriya, we were approached by one but didn’t ask much about how much it costs etc. The climb was quite steep at some points but the steps and railings helped a lot. It was good that we started early so the weather was not too hot and the pace was faster as there was no human jam. The views along the walk up, down and on top of the rock were spectacular. There were 3 rounds of ticket checking - first at the entrance towards the walk up, second at the mid way and third just before walking up the spiral staircase to view the paintings on the wall. We enjoyed Sigiriya very much! We were back on ground at visitors’ car park at about 8 am, just the right time for breakfast!"
"Go early to avoid the heat, and make sure to bring lots of water.  The view from the top is amazing!  The climb took about 45 minutes each way."
You must go early to this place and get your guide to have entry tickets before you get there (ticket office opens 06.45) 
Sigiriya rock is by far the best thing I've seen in Sri Lanka. It has been declared as the 8th wonder of the world by UNESCO and has a rich history associated with it. 
"A mix of Ramayana and Buddhism. That would best describe this place. This is one of the places, where Lord Buddha actually visited. This is a world heritage site. The climb is a must to the top and the view is breathtaking. almost every stone has a story and ensure that you have a good guide to appreciate the relevance to Ramayana. The place has some interesting sign boards (see photo attached). Don't let it deter you. It is worth the climb"
"There are many steps to climb just to get to the Lions Paw the a steep stairs to the top. A good level of fitness is required to get to the top. A Hat sunscreen and plenty of water is essential. The site at the top is surprisingly large. Care needs to be taken because of uneven ground and steps. A very interesting site for those able to get there. Views are wonderful. Watch out for unauthorised guides, There are no facilities once in the site so be prepared."
"It’s a must to do whilst in Sri Lanka. We stayed a stone throw away, so saw it each day at breakfast. It was a challenging hike to the top but worth the effort, even though it was hot at the top... it’s advisable to take a hat and wear sun screen. We had an amazing tour guide, so he informed us of the history and information throughout, which was helpful. "
"Go VERY early, it opens at 6 30 and you want to be one of he first up Less people and a more comfortable climb. A reasonable level of fitness and a good head for heights essential in parts."
"A steep climb up narrow steps following a steady line of visitors of all ages and ability - so thankful for the metal hand railing. At the top, a cool breeze, the ruins of a 5th-century palace and city, and a panoramic view of the plateau below. Largely the ruins are just foundations, there are a few standing walls. There are no services once you are inside the site so make sure you bring some drinking water; there isnt' any shade and the sun was hot (February). If you are bothered by heights you might find the ascent challenging. Monkeys lounge on the walls, scanning for signs of food, if you bring any food be careful; we saw a lady who was bitten trying to hold onto her snack from a thieving monkey."
"For me, in my opinion, I don’t think it was that great. There’s nothing up there and the way to go was a single track which you have to stucked with a lot of people. I prefer Pidurangala Rock but if you visit Sigiriya, go both rocks!"
"This is a fortress and ancient city which if you are there in Sigiriya, do visit. Be prepared for a little hike, with lots of stairs to climb, spiralling stairs, steep stairs, tiny stairs etc. But it's worth the walk and a little activity. Don't miss out the heritage site..."
We visited Sigiriya early morning - I think this was a wise choice by our guide due to the heat - Sigiriya is stunning and worth a visit but if you don’t like heights / small staircases on the side of a massive rock then this is not for you. The view from the top is amazing but getting there is hard work - we visited with children aged 6 and 10 and they loved the views but they had plenty of of questions of how / why / when etc and lucky for us the guide had the answers. 
"Sigiriya Lion's Rock is one of the best and famous attraction in Sri Lanka. If you are young and fit you should do this activity. It was so fun to Climb, There was so much to learn about history and technology used here. It was rainy day but it was not a big issue for us. It was fun, we enjoyed the rain. It's worth climb to see beautiful view from top of the Sigiriya. AMAZING! "
"I truly enjoyed climbing Sigiriya Rock. Got there early, and we were on our way at about 6:40 am. It’s hot here in April, so there was some serious sweating involved, but it’s not a huge hike really. Bring some water. Also we had our guide / driver with us who always has all the important stories to explain a place - really a great value add, considering there is just some rubble. I thought the entrance fee for a family of four, in excess of USD 100, quite steep, but I am glad we did it. "
"The earlier the better to beat the heat and the crowd. The entrance fee is 5310 rupee for foreigners, which is kind of pricy. It also includes Sigiriya museum that is in the same building of the ticket counter. "
"A big respect to my wife, she had fractured her ankle not long before we travelled but she made it to the top. What a climb !!!! If you are contemplating going make sure you go early in the morning otherwise the crowds are enormous, and take a bottle of water. Boots are not needed but trainers will suffice. Take your camera, excellent views from the top. Well worth a visit."
My daughter and I visited the rock at 630 in the morning. The weather is perfect for walking the rock at this time. 
"It's not just a climb up the rock but has an interesting history behind it. The climb it self was exhausting but with the short stops it helped us gain some breath. Once you reach the top, you totally forget the climb the views are just incredible. Would recommend this to everyone with a healthy heart."
My advice... do it in the morning before it gets too hot. There are steps to be climbed and it could be a challenge. Having said that it is really worth it just to be impressed with the human ingenuity that constructed such a temple. The view from the top is impressive. The frescoes that remain on the rock walls are stunning (note no photography allowed). The area is overall impressively maintained right down to the removal of the plastic wrapping from your drink bottle at the checkpoint. Your bags are also checked for any other plastic materials that could contaminate the site. A model other countries could follow. The stair case is quite safe though I can see it can become busy. The signs for hornets is advisory and definitely not an issue for us. Get there when the park opens to avoid the crowds. Certainly worth the climb. 
We were very excited to visit .. and more excited about the climb with my 6 year old. but trust me the journey was nice but the destination was not even worth the walk..
The ancient city was one of our favorite stops on our trip. The climb to the top of the rock is long but worth it. The view is incredible once you reach the top.
"What an experience it is to climb the rock. Our driver advised us to do it later in the afternoon to avoid the hottest part of the day but nevertheless, it was still nearly 30° when we climbed around 4pm. That said, it was worth it! It wasn’t as busy as some have said in previous reviews, although there were many people, we didn’t have to wait in long queues going up or down. Just the occasional pause to catch your breath and off you go again while others around you do the same. "
This area is fascinating. The museum gives a great insight into the achievements needed to creat a town on top of this rock thousands of years ago.
"Having spent 2 weeks travelling around Sri Lanka, Ella and Sigiriya had their own charms. Sigirya has alot more wildlife to offer. Many will also argue that 5000 rupees to climb the Lion's Rock is too expensive; which it is. However, if you are coming to Sigiriya then climbing the 2 large rocks is something that just has to be done! There are many steps but it is more straightforward than Pidurangala rock - just be aware that their are monkeys nearer to the top who will want to get into your backpacks!"
"We climbed the rock and where not let down, it’s best to have a guide so they can show you things and explain the history. We left our hotel at 6.10am to get to the rock as early as possible ! This was for two reasons to miss the majority of the other tourists and also to do it at the coolest time , I can highly recommend this as it a tough ascent and it gets hot an sweaty. The pain was well worth the it the view was stunning "
"I highly recommend bringing the exact amount of money you need to enter. The price is $35/person, and I dont recommend paying in their local currency as it fluctuates too much from day to day. "
"It was wonderful 
So I’m here at sri lanka together with my local boyfriend and he bring me to sigiriya and it’s was so worth it. It was so amazing as you can see all the ancients scribble and  rock formation. 

Nature is life"
We climbed it yesterday: went OK.
"We left our Sigiriya hotel early to take advantage of the cooler conditions, we drove half an hour to Sigiriya Rock Fortress, a UNESCO site that dates back to the 5th Century when established as a king's palace and fortress. It was later used as a Buddhist Monastery until the 14th Century. "
"We didn't quite make it for 6.30 as we'd hoped, but we had our tickets and were on our way before 7, and it only got crowded when we were on our way down."
"Climbing the rock of Sigiriya is an essential part of a visit to Sri Lanka and possibly the most memorable. It can be crowded and hot but experiencing the climb together with the thousands of Sri Lankan people is not to be missed. Get there early and take plenty of water. A back pack is a good idea to leave hands free as some of the climb is quite steep and exposed, although always robust and safe. There are a lot of steps but it is always crowded so the rate of climb is leisurely and does not feel strenuous for the older person. The climb itself is exciting and breathtaking, but there is also the most stunning cave art after a short stretch up a spiral staircase, and then the view from the top is marvellous."
"This site is huge: much of it is easily accessible at low level - ancient water gardens, fortifications etc. However the focus of the site is the Lion Rock and its fortress. Climbing this will be a challenge for many people. But if you think you are up to it, give it a go. It is mostly stepped, so easy-enough for the able-bodied. The views (even on a misty day) are fabulous. On the summit was a huge fortress evidence of which still remains. "
This is a tremendous site. It is the foundations of an ancient town existing BC. The main attraction is a vertical climb up a rock face to see the foundations of an ancient palace on the top. The climb is just over 1000 steps so you need to be fit and not suffer from vertigo. There are fabulous views and a stopping place two-thirds of the way up if you cannot make it to the top. It is wise to arrive early before 9.00am as it becomes very busy when coach trips arrive.
"This place is full of miracles and I Cant believe I climbed the 1200 plus steps! Such an amazing feeling when you reach the top! its hard to think how it was built at that time. It is a vast area with loads of architectural structures including ponds, Steps, Doors and many more."
The Ancient City of Sigiriya was amazing to see! But... we should have arrived earlier. When we got to the beginning of the path up it was crazy!! There were so many people pushing to get up the stairs. Mant travelers turned around and left to get out the madness. Get there early for less crazy!
I had a voucher so got the first ticket but then with my driver went to the museum which did not open till 8am so when on teh climb. Some tips take water and rest on your way if you can. Im not fit so had to rest on the way and at the top. Wonderful site and later in day returned to see the museum.
Incredible and absolutely worth the cost- as foreigners we should definitely pay more so I do not disagree with this.
The best advice I can give is to get up early and be at the ticket office when it opens at 6.30am
"We are not great explorers! However you cannot go to Sigiriya without giving the rock climb a go. As we discovered, luckily, you don't have to go all the way up but at least get yourself up to the rock paintings and lions feet. Yes it's all quite steep, getting down is harder) but take your time and go early (6:30am) to beat the crowds and heat - we were back at our accommodation nearby by about 8:30. At least you can say you did it!!"
"Finally - a UNESCO site worth the price of admission in Sri Lanka! Somehwat challenging walk - do it in the morning as the rock provides shade for most of the climb. Walk through the well-marked remains of royal gardens on way to the steps and stairs to the top. Once on top, in the midst of a medieval fortress, enjoy 360 degree views. It's a lot easier coming down. Get a pick in front of the Lion's Feet too. Nice breeze on top. Clean (relatively) bathrooms on site."
"The only point is given to the beautiful view of the lion rock, but the management of the site is absolutely TERRIBLE !!! "
My personal opinion is that Lion's rock is both easier and safer compared to Pidurangala. The view on top is amazing but it is primarily the vestiges of an ancient time that are strikingly magnificent.
"I climbed this rock with my two children ages 8 and 4. I was really concerned about the safety. Oh well, the climb is not unsafe at all. All the 1200 steps are well made. Few are bricked and others are metal stairs. They’re fenced as you go up. There are many places in between with shade where you can stop and rest. Its hot no doubt. Carry water and wear sunscreen and hats. Its gets windy as you go up so no worries. "
"Very impressive, but go as early as possible as it is very exposed and hot. We got there at 6.30 when it opens and there were a reasonable number of people there even then. When we were on the top at 8am it was very hot and obviously would be much warmer later in the day. There is little shade on the top."
My wife climbed the rock and as she is a keen rambler said the climb was not difficult at all. Lots of history of the area and well maintained gardens
"One of the highlights of our tour of Sri Lanka. The rock is a 260 metre climb, most of which is via steps on the shaded west side of the rock. "
Climbing sigiriya was one of the best thing I have ever done.It was a challenge.I did walk around the top very much and the view are breathtaking and well worth wobbly knees.It was a great sightseen in srilanka.
"Highlights: First, the walk to the top includes a wall of gorgeous frescoes as well as the incredible lion paw steps. These two stops along the hike make for welcome rest stops, and are really quite amazing! Second, the view from the top is breathtaking, and well worth the climb. Third, the monkeys were really friendly and quite adorable. They kept my spirits high as I began to run out of energy towards the top!"
1000+ steps to climb. It is best to visit early to avoid heat and crowds. View from top is fantastic.
"First of all be careful of large wasp who reside on the top of rock.!!! They attacked the people just after we left the place. few people were hospitalised, I heard. Old king has built the place. It's really worth to climb up and see the ancient paintings and the city ruins. but authorities should pay attention for preserve the paintings, and also the city ruins. Place was overall OK except the site guides on the bottom of rock and the entrance charge for tourist. site guides sometimes really annoying for tourists. someone should do something"
You want to start early as it gets hot and it gets busy. The rock does not look challenging from the base but it is hard work. Take it steady and all will be well.
"If you visited another ancient city in asian country I don’t suggest this place but if you are not it is to be missed. So hot so crowded long way to go up but when you arrive the best part is lion cave. Anything else except some ruined walls and rooms that has not clear information about the time . Elephant rock ,cobra rock shoud not to be missed."
"You need to climb 1200 steps (about 2 hours) to get to the top

No service or shaded areas

Not much to see on top"
"Get up early and get to the rock early before 9am to avoid the heat & crowds. The steep steps and climb to the top are well worth the views and experience .
Take your time going up and look back at the panoramic views!"
"although it can get pretty crowded and it is not a cheap place to visit, still I think that it is worth going there, a lot of climbing to the top compensates the breathtaking view and the remains let you think how it must have looked like in the past in its glory days"
This is an amazing sight to visit. Seen for miles around.If you manage the fairly strenuous walk/climb to the top you will not be disappointed. Its a must if your in this area but make sure you time it right. I climbed at 4.30pm just as it was getting cooler and in time to witness fantastic sunset.
"Is a fortress, high enought to see the neibourhoods. Is a unique senzation that you are on the top of the word, esspecialy because they don't have tall buildings."
text
The Ancient City of Sigiriya is a must visit when in Sri Lanka. Lion Rock is the towering location of King Kasyapa palace on the top.
"A homogenous blend of Ramayana and Buddhism. That would exactly describe this place and the perfect blend of the two cultures or ideally can be said religion. This is one of the places, where Lord Buddha actually visited. This is a world heritage site. The climb is a must to the top and the view is breathtaking. almost every stone has a story and ensure that you have a good guide to appreciate the relevance to Ramayana. Don't let it detour you. It is worth the climb.!!!"
"We did it,1202 steps to the top in the heat,we were so proud but it was well worth it."
We arrived about 7.30 am and there were already lots of people there! It is definitely worth getting there early as it is cooler and less crowds. We came down about 9am and it was very hot and very crowded.
Arrived around 9am with a guide. Lots of people but did not feel crowded. The grounds before the actual climb are magnificent and the history is fascinating. The entire climb around and up to the top is not too difficult. My husband has bad knees and managed most of the climb missing the last push to the top. There were people clearly nervous about heights and having to push themselves to the top but it is very achievable. Yes it was hot but only what we expected and manageable. This magnificent palace is carved out of granite and is truely something you will not want to miss. A must do.
"Sigiriya is the home of Lion Rock, a 200 m high rock and the site of a 5th-century palace and kingdom. Formed out of the magma of an extinct volcano, King Kasyapa chose the rock as a site for his palace and indeed his own kingdom. ﻿﻿The ancient rock palace has some very unique frescoes that are incredibly well-preserved considering they are more than 1,500 years old and at the plateau, you will find the beautiful gardens of Sigiriya, which are among the oldest landscaped gardens in the world."
There are no words for this place.  Only suggestion is to look at what the palace looked like before so when there you can use your imagination.
"Just as well we left at 7am in the morning, the steeps were fairly steep so not for the faint hearted.  Well worth being at the top but exhausting getting there."
This was a great experience and definitely worth doing. The views were spectacular and the history of Sigiriya is so interesting.
"We arrived at the museum at 07:00 as it opened to purchase tickets. We then went straight to the complex and started the climb to the summit. It was incredible, but I am scared of heights and it really pushed me. Everything was well coordinated and staffed. After exploring the summit we came back down and explored the rest of the ruins, then went to the museum which was very informative. "
We managed to do the hike and it took us about 45 minutes to reach the top. Lots of Tourist come here to visit the Sigiriya. There is a fee that needs to be paid at the entrance. We didn't take the tour guides but just followed the trail on the map provided. If you are a person that is afraid of height dont go there.
"The ancient city of Sigiriya was top of my list for things to do in Sri Lanka and maybe because of the expectation I was perhaps a little dissapointed by the hoardes of people visting, even first thing in the morning. That said, its still a five star and a must see in Sri Lanka and despite the steep entrance fee."
"This is a beautiful place. If you want to go to the top of this old fortress you have to climb over 1000 stepts.It`s not that hard, but it is very hot outside, so try and go early in the moring of at evening to see the sunset. And also, there are a lot of monkeys up there."
We visited early in the morning to avoid the heat. 
"We visited on a hot & humid morning and along with our allocated guide, were soon joined by another guide who offered to help my wife up the stairs. This was appreciated at the time as my wife was struggling with a painful knee. The experience is well worth the effort & the information provided by our guide was valuable in appreciating the site. Once at the top we thanked the second guide & offered him a 500 rupee tip. He said this was not acceptable and demanded a 2000 rupee tip. After returning to the bottom I offered our second guide a 2000 rupee tip but he said 3000 was his price. We never paid this much in tips any where else during our 2 weeks in Sri Lanka & found the guides at the Ancient Rock to be greedy & rude. Be sure to negotiate the tip before your tour starts."
"Yes, the view is great, there's a lion paw and some brick walls on the top. You need to try hard to imagine what those buildings could be once. Why is the mirror wall is called mirror??? It is just a yellow painted wall. Overall, it does not worth usd 30. Go to next hill Pidurangala for lkr 500. It's just too expensive for what you get."
Excellent plea wonderful UNESCO died and good view I'm recommend sigrya rook    good people waking buteful images
"The best ancient experience how a king has lived inside a Huge Massive Rock with all the Srilankan Paintings inside,
Really enjoyed visiting the World Unesco Heritage Site in Srilanka"
We climbed Lion Rock in the early morning (7 am) which was a good idea as the heat can be very taxing. I am 75 and have had coronary artery stents 12 months ago. The trail up was reasonably steep with many steps but many rest areas possible. When we reached the staging area for the ladders (the Lion’s paw) I was surprised that we were so close to the summit. The ladders are steep but safe. However if you are scared of heights do not do the final section as there is a shear drop that looks startling. Great views from the top and fascinating ruins. 
"Amazing history, paintings, architecture, techniques and view. Great place for every travelers who are able to climb. Other can wait down."
"As a lot of tour company’s seem to have cancelled their tours, there weren’t many people at Sigiriya when we climbed in the afternoon, maybe 20 people. Make sure you have time to explore the grounds after you climb by following the signs that go to the car park. We found that more interesting than the actual climb. It’s a beautiful area. When we came down there weren’t any tuk tuks around (perhaps a sign of less tourists) so we walked to our nearby hotel (beware of snakes and elephants if you have to do the same)."
Being 65 with arthritic knees I found going down to be more difficult that going up. It was 32 degrees with high humidity so that added to the degree of difficulty. However if you take your time and keep your fluids up it is certainly achievable. There are some grand views going up and the view from the top is magnificent. If it is physically possible for you to do the climb then do it.
"It was good, the best time to visit Sigiriya is as early as 6.30 am, when the sun is not hot & before the big local crowds come in or in the evening around 3.00 pm when the sin is going down."
Magical place. A very beautiful view from the hill. I recommend going Up. One of many obligatory places on Ceylon.
"Everybody tried to put us off climbing to the top. All the advice was that we should do it only in the early morning and when it wasn't so crowded. Needless to say we didn't have any choice as we were there at midday on a public holiday. It was hot, crowded and difficult (I found the first bit up the stone steps much harder than the bit after the Lions Paws where at least there was a handrail), but it was worth all the effort. Magnificent views!! Just don't believe that the local people are going to be polite and queue quietly. They push and shove you all the way and cut you up when they get the chance. They even tread on you to get in front. But there's never any rancour and they do it with a smile - and they don't seem to mind if you push and shove right back. In fact, be wary of anyone who extends a helping hand. They want money!"
"Must go of Sigiriya!
Very hot and very crowdy, you should go early in a morning
Dont forget to bring your water to the top
Stay away from the cheeky monkies :-)"
"Lots of beautiful nature. Climbing up is not easy, but I think it is possible to reach the top of every person. The most important thing is not to rush. We are not fast, just a little bit rested. The most important thing is to have water. Beautiful panoramic views can be seen from the top. From the top of the hill we landed down quickly, as it was easy to get down."
I arrived relatively early around 8:30am and purchased a ticket there. There weren’t any queues really which was great. I did this on my own with no guide and really enjoyed it. I do think a guide may have given me a bit more knowledge of the place though. It was busy and the climb was hot! The views are absolutely out of this world. I would highly recommend this experience if you are in srilanka.
Worth getting up early to do this climb both for the heat and for the number of people passing on the staircase going up the side of the rock. I'd prepared myself for a much longer climb but reached the top quicker than i thought. We had a guide who told us some interesting information but it's not necessary. The views in all directions are spectacular. We left our hotel at 6am and were back having breakfast by 9.30. Lots of savvy monkeys around so hang on to your valuables!
It is a beautiful site initially approaching the rock through the ponds. You can imagine what it was like when the empire was at its heights. Once you reach the base of the rock its then a easy walk up the the wall of mirrors. Once you reach the Lion's Paw there is a plateau where you get some fantastic views and a good rest stop - then its a vertical stair climb up to the top of the rock. This was the toughest part mainly due to the heat and crowds (it was mid morning) Once you reach the top of the rock you are rewarded with a beautiful view of the surrounding area - well worth the climb up!
"Amazing experience, worth the climb. So much history in this area. Enjoyed the museum tour before to explain the site and its history and significance for Sri Lanka."
In title itself I mentioned both sides of the place.
Just do it. Get over the height and climb to see one of the great sights. Either the build was genius or folly but either way amazing
"I have recently visited sigiriya rock. It was impressive with lots of things to see (gardens, caves etc), however I feel the toughness of the climb gets played down slightly. The steps really are tough, especially the last section. I am great with heights and even I was starting to get a bit wobbly towards the top. When you get to the top the views are worth it. We set off early and got there about 8.15, by the time we got to the top it was 35 degrees and only 9.30 in the morning. I would suggest going as early as possible to avoid the heat and crowds. The crowds were fine at the time we went. One final thing. At the lion feet location, if you decide not to proceed to the top there is an open area with water to wait. This area seemed quite busy (people"
"The other being the Blue Whale we saw, so this is a high bar! Physically beautiful and historically fascinating must-see. Recommend visiting very early in the morning - it is worth an early wake-up to get to the top with a handful of people and not have to snake up the steep stairs with an endless crowd in the hot sun."
Our guide did tell us that to climb the rock in the morning is easier but it's busier as more tourists do the morning climb.
Its a must visit place in Sri Lanka. It is also UNESCO's world heritage site. Once you go there you should climb to the top as the views on the way is amazing seeing all beautiful nature and amazing Sri Lanka. Please take water with you and also try to go in the morning.
"The rock fortress, Ancient City of Sigiriya, is not only iconic because it is UNESCO heritage, but also because of its beautiful history. If you get a chance do read about King Visthavasa and his empire. The frescos that adorn the walls and the architecture are still considered a marvel. "
One of the best in Sri Lanka. I invite ppls to visit this place if not visited. And also make sure you go early  in the morning  so that sun will not be an issue at all.
"We got up early to climb Lion Rock and we're very glad we did! Although we arrived a little late because of an elephant-in-the-road situation! A lovely array of gardens and ponds flank the path that leads towards the start of the walk. There are quite a few stairs, so I'd probably recommend decent shoes - but it wasn't as hard as we were expecting. Doing it early meant that the majority of the path up the rock was in it's shade. Great views of the surrounding area at the top,but not much shade so you can't spend more than about 30 mins there. "
"I was in Sri Lanka for 15 days. I took an early morning bus from Kandy bus station to Dam bulla. I then took another public bus from Dam bulla main bus station to Sigiriya. The bus fare is only 40 rupees. The bus conductor was kind enough to alert me when the bus arrived at the town nearest to the Sigiriya Lion Rock. From this town, it was about 15 mins walk away from the entrance of the attraction. "
"Comparatively it’s an expensive excursion ($30/pp) but it was really cool to see and learn more about the history. The hike up is quite tough, and we did it in the middle of the day (which I do not recommend!). Best to go for early morning or later on for sunset (unsure of how late you can go up). The views from the top are amazing, and the ruins are interesting to walk around."
"An impressive rock on which there used to be the king’s palace built in the 5th century. Now there are only foundations of these buildings left. Metal walkways are steep and narrow, which might be a challenge for somebody. It’s definitely worth to climb on the top of the rock, as the view is amazing, although in a hot day it’s not an easy walk."
All About Sri Lanka travel crew has hosted more than 1000+ happy travelers in the past 15+ years and Sigiriya is one of the best attractions for every traveler. This is a true marvel of ancient Sri Lanka and it resembles the rich culture and history that goes back to thousands of years.
"This is the highlight of our Sigiriya visit. Our chauffeur guide started us early at 630 am. When we arrived at the ticket office there was already a short queue. Each foreign adult ticket cost LKR5,310/- or USD30/-. We skipped the museum and headed straight for the walk up the rock. Our chauffeur guide could not walk up with us as only licensed guide for the Sigiriya is allowed to conduct guided tour there, but he showed us the way. It was quite easy to follow the path as many people were walking the same way. You can engage a licensed guide inside the Sigiriya, we were approached by one but didn’t ask much about how much it costs etc. The climb was quite steep at some points but the steps and railings helped a lot. It was good that we started early so the weather was not too hot and the pace was faster as there was no human jam. The views along the walk up, down and on top of the rock were spectacular. There were 3 rounds of ticket checking - first at the entrance towards the walk up, second at the mid way and third just before walking up the spiral staircase to view the paintings on the wall. We enjoyed Sigiriya very much! We were back on ground at visitors’ car park at about 8 am, just the right time for breakfast!"
"Go early to avoid the heat, and make sure to bring lots of water.  The view from the top is amazing!  The climb took about 45 minutes each way."
You must go early to this place and get your guide to have entry tickets before you get there (ticket office opens 06.45) 
Sigiriya rock is by far the best thing I've seen in Sri Lanka. It has been declared as the 8th wonder of the world by UNESCO and has a rich history associated with it. 
"A mix of Ramayana and Buddhism. That would best describe this place. This is one of the places, where Lord Buddha actually visited. This is a world heritage site. The climb is a must to the top and the view is breathtaking. almost every stone has a story and ensure that you have a good guide to appreciate the relevance to Ramayana. The place has some interesting sign boards (see photo attached). Don't let it deter you. It is worth the climb"
"There are many steps to climb just to get to the Lions Paw the a steep stairs to the top. A good level of fitness is required to get to the top. A Hat sunscreen and plenty of water is essential. The site at the top is surprisingly large. Care needs to be taken because of uneven ground and steps. A very interesting site for those able to get there. Views are wonderful. Watch out for unauthorised guides, There are no facilities once in the site so be prepared."
"It’s a must to do whilst in Sri Lanka. We stayed a stone throw away, so saw it each day at breakfast. It was a challenging hike to the top but worth the effort, even though it was hot at the top... it’s advisable to take a hat and wear sun screen. We had an amazing tour guide, so he informed us of the history and information throughout, which was helpful. "
"Go VERY early, it opens at 6 30 and you want to be one of he first up Less people and a more comfortable climb. A reasonable level of fitness and a good head for heights essential in parts."
"A steep climb up narrow steps following a steady line of visitors of all ages and ability - so thankful for the metal hand railing. At the top, a cool breeze, the ruins of a 5th-century palace and city, and a panoramic view of the plateau below. Largely the ruins are just foundations, there are a few standing walls. There are no services once you are inside the site so make sure you bring some drinking water; there isnt' any shade and the sun was hot (February). If you are bothered by heights you might find the ascent challenging. Monkeys lounge on the walls, scanning for signs of food, if you bring any food be careful; we saw a lady who was bitten trying to hold onto her snack from a thieving monkey."
"For me, in my opinion, I don’t think it was that great. There’s nothing up there and the way to go was a single track which you have to stucked with a lot of people. I prefer Pidurangala Rock but if you visit Sigiriya, go both rocks!"
"This is a fortress and ancient city which if you are there in Sigiriya, do visit. Be prepared for a little hike, with lots of stairs to climb, spiralling stairs, steep stairs, tiny stairs etc. But it's worth the walk and a little activity. Don't miss out the heritage site..."
We visited Sigiriya early morning - I think this was a wise choice by our guide due to the heat - Sigiriya is stunning and worth a visit but if you don’t like heights / small staircases on the side of a massive rock then this is not for you. The view from the top is amazing but getting there is hard work - we visited with children aged 6 and 10 and they loved the views but they had plenty of of questions of how / why / when etc and lucky for us the guide had the answers. 
"Sigiriya Lion's Rock is one of the best and famous attraction in Sri Lanka. If you are young and fit you should do this activity. It was so fun to Climb, There was so much to learn about history and technology used here. It was rainy day but it was not a big issue for us. It was fun, we enjoyed the rain. It's worth climb to see beautiful view from top of the Sigiriya. AMAZING! "
"I truly enjoyed climbing Sigiriya Rock. Got there early, and we were on our way at about 6:40 am. It’s hot here in April, so there was some serious sweating involved, but it’s not a huge hike really. Bring some water. Also we had our guide / driver with us who always has all the important stories to explain a place - really a great value add, considering there is just some rubble. I thought the entrance fee for a family of four, in excess of USD 100, quite steep, but I am glad we did it. "
"The earlier the better to beat the heat and the crowd. The entrance fee is 5310 rupee for foreigners, which is kind of pricy. It also includes Sigiriya museum that is in the same building of the ticket counter. "
"A big respect to my wife, she had fractured her ankle not long before we travelled but she made it to the top. What a climb !!!! If you are contemplating going make sure you go early in the morning otherwise the crowds are enormous, and take a bottle of water. Boots are not needed but trainers will suffice. Take your camera, excellent views from the top. Well worth a visit."
My daughter and I visited the rock at 630 in the morning. The weather is perfect for walking the rock at this time. 
"It's not just a climb up the rock but has an interesting history behind it. The climb it self was exhausting but with the short stops it helped us gain some breath. Once you reach the top, you totally forget the climb the views are just incredible. Would recommend this to everyone with a healthy heart."
My advice... do it in the morning before it gets too hot. There are steps to be climbed and it could be a challenge. Having said that it is really worth it just to be impressed with the human ingenuity that constructed such a temple. The view from the top is impressive. The frescoes that remain on the rock walls are stunning (note no photography allowed). The area is overall impressively maintained right down to the removal of the plastic wrapping from your drink bottle at the checkpoint. Your bags are also checked for any other plastic materials that could contaminate the site. A model other countries could follow. The stair case is quite safe though I can see it can become busy. The signs for hornets is advisory and definitely not an issue for us. Get there when the park opens to avoid the crowds. Certainly worth the climb. 
We were very excited to visit .. and more excited about the climb with my 6 year old. but trust me the journey was nice but the destination was not even worth the walk..
The ancient city was one of our favorite stops on our trip. The climb to the top of the rock is long but worth it. The view is incredible once you reach the top.
"What an experience it is to climb the rock. Our driver advised us to do it later in the afternoon to avoid the hottest part of the day but nevertheless, it was still nearly 30° when we climbed around 4pm. That said, it was worth it! It wasn’t as busy as some have said in previous reviews, although there were many people, we didn’t have to wait in long queues going up or down. Just the occasional pause to catch your breath and off you go again while others around you do the same. "
This area is fascinating. The museum gives a great insight into the achievements needed to creat a town on top of this rock thousands of years ago.
"Having spent 2 weeks travelling around Sri Lanka, Ella and Sigiriya had their own charms. Sigirya has alot more wildlife to offer. Many will also argue that 5000 rupees to climb the Lion's Rock is too expensive; which it is. However, if you are coming to Sigiriya then climbing the 2 large rocks is something that just has to be done! There are many steps but it is more straightforward than Pidurangala rock - just be aware that their are monkeys nearer to the top who will want to get into your backpacks!"
"We climbed the rock and where not let down, it’s best to have a guide so they can show you things and explain the history. We left our hotel at 6.10am to get to the rock as early as possible ! This was for two reasons to miss the majority of the other tourists and also to do it at the coolest time , I can highly recommend this as it a tough ascent and it gets hot an sweaty. The pain was well worth the it the view was stunning "
"I highly recommend bringing the exact amount of money you need to enter. The price is $35/person, and I dont recommend paying in their local currency as it fluctuates too much from day to day. "
"It was wonderful 
So I’m here at sri lanka together with my local boyfriend and he bring me to sigiriya and it’s was so worth it. It was so amazing as you can see all the ancients scribble and  rock formation. 

Nature is life"
We climbed it yesterday: went OK.
"We left our Sigiriya hotel early to take advantage of the cooler conditions, we drove half an hour to Sigiriya Rock Fortress, a UNESCO site that dates back to the 5th Century when established as a king's palace and fortress. It was later used as a Buddhist Monastery until the 14th Century. "
"We didn't quite make it for 6.30 as we'd hoped, but we had our tickets and were on our way before 7, and it only got crowded when we were on our way down."
"Climbing the rock of Sigiriya is an essential part of a visit to Sri Lanka and possibly the most memorable. It can be crowded and hot but experiencing the climb together with the thousands of Sri Lankan people is not to be missed. Get there early and take plenty of water. A back pack is a good idea to leave hands free as some of the climb is quite steep and exposed, although always robust and safe. There are a lot of steps but it is always crowded so the rate of climb is leisurely and does not feel strenuous for the older person. The climb itself is exciting and breathtaking, but there is also the most stunning cave art after a short stretch up a spiral staircase, and then the view from the top is marvellous."
"This site is huge: much of it is easily accessible at low level - ancient water gardens, fortifications etc. However the focus of the site is the Lion Rock and its fortress. Climbing this will be a challenge for many people. But if you think you are up to it, give it a go. It is mostly stepped, so easy-enough for the able-bodied. The views (even on a misty day) are fabulous. On the summit was a huge fortress evidence of which still remains. "
This is a tremendous site. It is the foundations of an ancient town existing BC. The main attraction is a vertical climb up a rock face to see the foundations of an ancient palace on the top. The climb is just over 1000 steps so you need to be fit and not suffer from vertigo. There are fabulous views and a stopping place two-thirds of the way up if you cannot make it to the top. It is wise to arrive early before 9.00am as it becomes very busy when coach trips arrive.
"This place is full of miracles and I Cant believe I climbed the 1200 plus steps! Such an amazing feeling when you reach the top! its hard to think how it was built at that time. It is a vast area with loads of architectural structures including ponds, Steps, Doors and many more."
The Ancient City of Sigiriya was amazing to see! But... we should have arrived earlier. When we got to the beginning of the path up it was crazy!! There were so many people pushing to get up the stairs. Mant travelers turned around and left to get out the madness. Get there early for less crazy!
I had a voucher so got the first ticket but then with my driver went to the museum which did not open till 8am so when on teh climb. Some tips take water and rest on your way if you can. Im not fit so had to rest on the way and at the top. Wonderful site and later in day returned to see the museum.
Incredible and absolutely worth the cost- as foreigners we should definitely pay more so I do not disagree with this.
The best advice I can give is to get up early and be at the ticket office when it opens at 6.30am
"We are not great explorers! However you cannot go to Sigiriya without giving the rock climb a go. As we discovered, luckily, you don't have to go all the way up but at least get yourself up to the rock paintings and lions feet. Yes it's all quite steep, getting down is harder) but take your time and go early (6:30am) to beat the crowds and heat - we were back at our accommodation nearby by about 8:30. At least you can say you did it!!"
"Finally - a UNESCO site worth the price of admission in Sri Lanka! Somehwat challenging walk - do it in the morning as the rock provides shade for most of the climb. Walk through the well-marked remains of royal gardens on way to the steps and stairs to the top. Once on top, in the midst of a medieval fortress, enjoy 360 degree views. It's a lot easier coming down. Get a pick in front of the Lion's Feet too. Nice breeze on top. Clean (relatively) bathrooms on site."
"The only point is given to the beautiful view of the lion rock, but the management of the site is absolutely TERRIBLE !!! "
My personal opinion is that Lion's rock is both easier and safer compared to Pidurangala. The view on top is amazing but it is primarily the vestiges of an ancient time that are strikingly magnificent.
"I climbed this rock with my two children ages 8 and 4. I was really concerned about the safety. Oh well, the climb is not unsafe at all. All the 1200 steps are well made. Few are bricked and others are metal stairs. They’re fenced as you go up. There are many places in between with shade where you can stop and rest. Its hot no doubt. Carry water and wear sunscreen and hats. Its gets windy as you go up so no worries. "
"Very impressive, but go as early as possible as it is very exposed and hot. We got there at 6.30 when it opens and there were a reasonable number of people there even then. When we were on the top at 8am it was very hot and obviously would be much warmer later in the day. There is little shade on the top."
My wife climbed the rock and as she is a keen rambler said the climb was not difficult at all. Lots of history of the area and well maintained gardens
"One of the highlights of our tour of Sri Lanka. The rock is a 260 metre climb, most of which is via steps on the shaded west side of the rock. "
Climbing sigiriya was one of the best thing I have ever done.It was a challenge.I did walk around the top very much and the view are breathtaking and well worth wobbly knees.It was a great sightseen in srilanka.
"Highlights: First, the walk to the top includes a wall of gorgeous frescoes as well as the incredible lion paw steps. These two stops along the hike make for welcome rest stops, and are really quite amazing! Second, the view from the top is breathtaking, and well worth the climb. Third, the monkeys were really friendly and quite adorable. They kept my spirits high as I began to run out of energy towards the top!"
1000+ steps to climb. It is best to visit early to avoid heat and crowds. View from top is fantastic.
"First of all be careful of large wasp who reside on the top of rock.!!! They attacked the people just after we left the place. few people were hospitalised, I heard. Old king has built the place. It's really worth to climb up and see the ancient paintings and the city ruins. but authorities should pay attention for preserve the paintings, and also the city ruins. Place was overall OK except the site guides on the bottom of rock and the entrance charge for tourist. site guides sometimes really annoying for tourists. someone should do something"
You want to start early as it gets hot and it gets busy. The rock does not look challenging from the base but it is hard work. Take it steady and all will be well.
"If you visited another ancient city in asian country I don’t suggest this place but if you are not it is to be missed. So hot so crowded long way to go up but when you arrive the best part is lion cave. Anything else except some ruined walls and rooms that has not clear information about the time . Elephant rock ,cobra rock shoud not to be missed."
"You need to climb 1200 steps (about 2 hours) to get to the top

No service or shaded areas

Not much to see on top"
"Get up early and get to the rock early before 9am to avoid the heat & crowds. The steep steps and climb to the top are well worth the views and experience .
Take your time going up and look back at the panoramic views!"
"although it can get pretty crowded and it is not a cheap place to visit, still I think that it is worth going there, a lot of climbing to the top compensates the breathtaking view and the remains let you think how it must have looked like in the past in its glory days"
This is an amazing sight to visit. Seen for miles around.If you manage the fairly strenuous walk/climb to the top you will not be disappointed. Its a must if your in this area but make sure you time it right. I climbed at 4.30pm just as it was getting cooler and in time to witness fantastic sunset.
text
The Ancient City of Sigiriya is a must visit when in Sri Lanka. Lion Rock is the towering location of King Kasyapa palace on the top.
"A homogenous blend of Ramayana and Buddhism. That would exactly describe this place and the perfect blend of the two cultures or ideally can be said religion. This is one of the places, where Lord Buddha actually visited. This is a world heritage site. The climb is a must to the top and the view is breathtaking. almost every stone has a story and ensure that you have a good guide to appreciate the relevance to Ramayana. Don't let it detour you. It is worth the climb.!!!"
"We did it,1202 steps to the top in the heat,we were so proud but it was well worth it."
We arrived about 7.30 am and there were already lots of people there! It is definitely worth getting there early as it is cooler and less crowds. We came down about 9am and it was very hot and very crowded.
Arrived around 9am with a guide. Lots of people but did not feel crowded. The grounds before the actual climb are magnificent and the history is fascinating. The entire climb around and up to the top is not too difficult. My husband has bad knees and managed most of the climb missing the last push to the top. There were people clearly nervous about heights and having to push themselves to the top but it is very achievable. Yes it was hot but only what we expected and manageable. This magnificent palace is carved out of granite and is truely something you will not want to miss. A must do.
"Sigiriya is the home of Lion Rock, a 200 m high rock and the site of a 5th-century palace and kingdom. Formed out of the magma of an extinct volcano, King Kasyapa chose the rock as a site for his palace and indeed his own kingdom. ﻿﻿The ancient rock palace has some very unique frescoes that are incredibly well-preserved considering they are more than 1,500 years old and at the plateau, you will find the beautiful gardens of Sigiriya, which are among the oldest landscaped gardens in the world."
There are no words for this place.  Only suggestion is to look at what the palace looked like before so when there you can use your imagination.
"Just as well we left at 7am in the morning, the steeps were fairly steep so not for the faint hearted.  Well worth being at the top but exhausting getting there."
This was a great experience and definitely worth doing. The views were spectacular and the history of Sigiriya is so interesting.
"We arrived at the museum at 07:00 as it opened to purchase tickets. We then went straight to the complex and started the climb to the summit. It was incredible, but I am scared of heights and it really pushed me. Everything was well coordinated and staffed. After exploring the summit we came back down and explored the rest of the ruins, then went to the museum which was very informative. "
We managed to do the hike and it took us about 45 minutes to reach the top. Lots of Tourist come here to visit the Sigiriya. There is a fee that needs to be paid at the entrance. We didn't take the tour guides but just followed the trail on the map provided. If you are a person that is afraid of height dont go there.
"The ancient city of Sigiriya was top of my list for things to do in Sri Lanka and maybe because of the expectation I was perhaps a little dissapointed by the hoardes of people visting, even first thing in the morning. That said, its still a five star and a must see in Sri Lanka and despite the steep entrance fee."
"This is a beautiful place. If you want to go to the top of this old fortress you have to climb over 1000 stepts.It`s not that hard, but it is very hot outside, so try and go early in the moring of at evening to see the sunset. And also, there are a lot of monkeys up there."
We visited early in the morning to avoid the heat. 
"We visited on a hot & humid morning and along with our allocated guide, were soon joined by another guide who offered to help my wife up the stairs. This was appreciated at the time as my wife was struggling with a painful knee. The experience is well worth the effort & the information provided by our guide was valuable in appreciating the site. Once at the top we thanked the second guide & offered him a 500 rupee tip. He said this was not acceptable and demanded a 2000 rupee tip. After returning to the bottom I offered our second guide a 2000 rupee tip but he said 3000 was his price. We never paid this much in tips any where else during our 2 weeks in Sri Lanka & found the guides at the Ancient Rock to be greedy & rude. Be sure to negotiate the tip before your tour starts."
"Yes, the view is great, there's a lion paw and some brick walls on the top. You need to try hard to imagine what those buildings could be once. Why is the mirror wall is called mirror??? It is just a yellow painted wall. Overall, it does not worth usd 30. Go to next hill Pidurangala for lkr 500. It's just too expensive for what you get."
Excellent plea wonderful UNESCO died and good view I'm recommend sigrya rook    good people waking buteful images
"The best ancient experience how a king has lived inside a Huge Massive Rock with all the Srilankan Paintings inside,
Really enjoyed visiting the World Unesco Heritage Site in Srilanka"
We climbed Lion Rock in the early morning (7 am) which was a good idea as the heat can be very taxing. I am 75 and have had coronary artery stents 12 months ago. The trail up was reasonably steep with many steps but many rest areas possible. When we reached the staging area for the ladders (the Lion’s paw) I was surprised that we were so close to the summit. The ladders are steep but safe. However if you are scared of heights do not do the final section as there is a shear drop that looks startling. Great views from the top and fascinating ruins. 
"Amazing history, paintings, architecture, techniques and view. Great place for every travelers who are able to climb. Other can wait down."
"As a lot of tour company’s seem to have cancelled their tours, there weren’t many people at Sigiriya when we climbed in the afternoon, maybe 20 people. Make sure you have time to explore the grounds after you climb by following the signs that go to the car park. We found that more interesting than the actual climb. It’s a beautiful area. When we came down there weren’t any tuk tuks around (perhaps a sign of less tourists) so we walked to our nearby hotel (beware of snakes and elephants if you have to do the same)."
Being 65 with arthritic knees I found going down to be more difficult that going up. It was 32 degrees with high humidity so that added to the degree of difficulty. However if you take your time and keep your fluids up it is certainly achievable. There are some grand views going up and the view from the top is magnificent. If it is physically possible for you to do the climb then do it.
"It was good, the best time to visit Sigiriya is as early as 6.30 am, when the sun is not hot & before the big local crowds come in or in the evening around 3.00 pm when the sin is going down."
Magical place. A very beautiful view from the hill. I recommend going Up. One of many obligatory places on Ceylon.
"Everybody tried to put us off climbing to the top. All the advice was that we should do it only in the early morning and when it wasn't so crowded. Needless to say we didn't have any choice as we were there at midday on a public holiday. It was hot, crowded and difficult (I found the first bit up the stone steps much harder than the bit after the Lions Paws where at least there was a handrail), but it was worth all the effort. Magnificent views!! Just don't believe that the local people are going to be polite and queue quietly. They push and shove you all the way and cut you up when they get the chance. They even tread on you to get in front. But there's never any rancour and they do it with a smile - and they don't seem to mind if you push and shove right back. In fact, be wary of anyone who extends a helping hand. They want money!"
"Must go of Sigiriya!
Very hot and very crowdy, you should go early in a morning
Dont forget to bring your water to the top
Stay away from the cheeky monkies :-)"
"Lots of beautiful nature. Climbing up is not easy, but I think it is possible to reach the top of every person. The most important thing is not to rush. We are not fast, just a little bit rested. The most important thing is to have water. Beautiful panoramic views can be seen from the top. From the top of the hill we landed down quickly, as it was easy to get down."
I arrived relatively early around 8:30am and purchased a ticket there. There weren’t any queues really which was great. I did this on my own with no guide and really enjoyed it. I do think a guide may have given me a bit more knowledge of the place though. It was busy and the climb was hot! The views are absolutely out of this world. I would highly recommend this experience if you are in srilanka.
Worth getting up early to do this climb both for the heat and for the number of people passing on the staircase going up the side of the rock. I'd prepared myself for a much longer climb but reached the top quicker than i thought. We had a guide who told us some interesting information but it's not necessary. The views in all directions are spectacular. We left our hotel at 6am and were back having breakfast by 9.30. Lots of savvy monkeys around so hang on to your valuables!
It is a beautiful site initially approaching the rock through the ponds. You can imagine what it was like when the empire was at its heights. Once you reach the base of the rock its then a easy walk up the the wall of mirrors. Once you reach the Lion's Paw there is a plateau where you get some fantastic views and a good rest stop - then its a vertical stair climb up to the top of the rock. This was the toughest part mainly due to the heat and crowds (it was mid morning) Once you reach the top of the rock you are rewarded with a beautiful view of the surrounding area - well worth the climb up!
"Amazing experience, worth the climb. So much history in this area. Enjoyed the museum tour before to explain the site and its history and significance for Sri Lanka."
In title itself I mentioned both sides of the place.
Just do it. Get over the height and climb to see one of the great sights. Either the build was genius or folly but either way amazing
"I have recently visited sigiriya rock. It was impressive with lots of things to see (gardens, caves etc), however I feel the toughness of the climb gets played down slightly. The steps really are tough, especially the last section. I am great with heights and even I was starting to get a bit wobbly towards the top. When you get to the top the views are worth it. We set off early and got there about 8.15, by the time we got to the top it was 35 degrees and only 9.30 in the morning. I would suggest going as early as possible to avoid the heat and crowds. The crowds were fine at the time we went. One final thing. At the lion feet location, if you decide not to proceed to the top there is an open area with water to wait. This area seemed quite busy (people"
"The other being the Blue Whale we saw, so this is a high bar! Physically beautiful and historically fascinating must-see. Recommend visiting very early in the morning - it is worth an early wake-up to get to the top with a handful of people and not have to snake up the steep stairs with an endless crowd in the hot sun."
Our guide did tell us that to climb the rock in the morning is easier but it's busier as more tourists do the morning climb.
Its a must visit place in Sri Lanka. It is also UNESCO's world heritage site. Once you go there you should climb to the top as the views on the way is amazing seeing all beautiful nature and amazing Sri Lanka. Please take water with you and also try to go in the morning.
"The rock fortress, Ancient City of Sigiriya, is not only iconic because it is UNESCO heritage, but also because of its beautiful history. If you get a chance do read about King Visthavasa and his empire. The frescos that adorn the walls and the architecture are still considered a marvel. "
One of the best in Sri Lanka. I invite ppls to visit this place if not visited. And also make sure you go early  in the morning  so that sun will not be an issue at all.
"We got up early to climb Lion Rock and we're very glad we did! Although we arrived a little late because of an elephant-in-the-road situation! A lovely array of gardens and ponds flank the path that leads towards the start of the walk. There are quite a few stairs, so I'd probably recommend decent shoes - but it wasn't as hard as we were expecting. Doing it early meant that the majority of the path up the rock was in it's shade. Great views of the surrounding area at the top,but not much shade so you can't spend more than about 30 mins there. "
"I was in Sri Lanka for 15 days. I took an early morning bus from Kandy bus station to Dam bulla. I then took another public bus from Dam bulla main bus station to Sigiriya. The bus fare is only 40 rupees. The bus conductor was kind enough to alert me when the bus arrived at the town nearest to the Sigiriya Lion Rock. From this town, it was about 15 mins walk away from the entrance of the attraction. "
"Comparatively it’s an expensive excursion ($30/pp) but it was really cool to see and learn more about the history. The hike up is quite tough, and we did it in the middle of the day (which I do not recommend!). Best to go for early morning or later on for sunset (unsure of how late you can go up). The views from the top are amazing, and the ruins are interesting to walk around."
"An impressive rock on which there used to be the king’s palace built in the 5th century. Now there are only foundations of these buildings left. Metal walkways are steep and narrow, which might be a challenge for somebody. It’s definitely worth to climb on the top of the rock, as the view is amazing, although in a hot day it’s not an easy walk."
All About Sri Lanka travel crew has hosted more than 1000+ happy travelers in the past 15+ years and Sigiriya is one of the best attractions for every traveler. This is a true marvel of ancient Sri Lanka and it resembles the rich culture and history that goes back to thousands of years.
"This is the highlight of our Sigiriya visit. Our chauffeur guide started us early at 630 am. When we arrived at the ticket office there was already a short queue. Each foreign adult ticket cost LKR5,310/- or USD30/-. We skipped the museum and headed straight for the walk up the rock. Our chauffeur guide could not walk up with us as only licensed guide for the Sigiriya is allowed to conduct guided tour there, but he showed us the way. It was quite easy to follow the path as many people were walking the same way. You can engage a licensed guide inside the Sigiriya, we were approached by one but didn’t ask much about how much it costs etc. The climb was quite steep at some points but the steps and railings helped a lot. It was good that we started early so the weather was not too hot and the pace was faster as there was no human jam. The views along the walk up, down and on top of the rock were spectacular. There were 3 rounds of ticket checking - first at the entrance towards the walk up, second at the mid way and third just before walking up the spiral staircase to view the paintings on the wall. We enjoyed Sigiriya very much! We were back on ground at visitors’ car park at about 8 am, just the right time for breakfast!"
"Go early to avoid the heat, and make sure to bring lots of water.  The view from the top is amazing!  The climb took about 45 minutes each way."
You must go early to this place and get your guide to have entry tickets before you get there (ticket office opens 06.45) 
Sigiriya rock is by far the best thing I've seen in Sri Lanka. It has been declared as the 8th wonder of the world by UNESCO and has a rich history associated with it. 
"A mix of Ramayana and Buddhism. That would best describe this place. This is one of the places, where Lord Buddha actually visited. This is a world heritage site. The climb is a must to the top and the view is breathtaking. almost every stone has a story and ensure that you have a good guide to appreciate the relevance to Ramayana. The place has some interesting sign boards (see photo attached). Don't let it deter you. It is worth the climb"
"There are many steps to climb just to get to the Lions Paw the a steep stairs to the top. A good level of fitness is required to get to the top. A Hat sunscreen and plenty of water is essential. The site at the top is surprisingly large. Care needs to be taken because of uneven ground and steps. A very interesting site for those able to get there. Views are wonderful. Watch out for unauthorised guides, There are no facilities once in the site so be prepared."
"It’s a must to do whilst in Sri Lanka. We stayed a stone throw away, so saw it each day at breakfast. It was a challenging hike to the top but worth the effort, even though it was hot at the top... it’s advisable to take a hat and wear sun screen. We had an amazing tour guide, so he informed us of the history and information throughout, which was helpful. "
"Go VERY early, it opens at 6 30 and you want to be one of he first up Less people and a more comfortable climb. A reasonable level of fitness and a good head for heights essential in parts."
"A steep climb up narrow steps following a steady line of visitors of all ages and ability - so thankful for the metal hand railing. At the top, a cool breeze, the ruins of a 5th-century palace and city, and a panoramic view of the plateau below. Largely the ruins are just foundations, there are a few standing walls. There are no services once you are inside the site so make sure you bring some drinking water; there isnt' any shade and the sun was hot (February). If you are bothered by heights you might find the ascent challenging. Monkeys lounge on the walls, scanning for signs of food, if you bring any food be careful; we saw a lady who was bitten trying to hold onto her snack from a thieving monkey."
"For me, in my opinion, I don’t think it was that great. There’s nothing up there and the way to go was a single track which you have to stucked with a lot of people. I prefer Pidurangala Rock but if you visit Sigiriya, go both rocks!"
"This is a fortress and ancient city which if you are there in Sigiriya, do visit. Be prepared for a little hike, with lots of stairs to climb, spiralling stairs, steep stairs, tiny stairs etc. But it's worth the walk and a little activity. Don't miss out the heritage site..."
We visited Sigiriya early morning - I think this was a wise choice by our guide due to the heat - Sigiriya is stunning and worth a visit but if you don’t like heights / small staircases on the side of a massive rock then this is not for you. The view from the top is amazing but getting there is hard work - we visited with children aged 6 and 10 and they loved the views but they had plenty of of questions of how / why / when etc and lucky for us the guide had the answers. 
"Sigiriya Lion's Rock is one of the best and famous attraction in Sri Lanka. If you are young and fit you should do this activity. It was so fun to Climb, There was so much to learn about history and technology used here. It was rainy day but it was not a big issue for us. It was fun, we enjoyed the rain. It's worth climb to see beautiful view from top of the Sigiriya. AMAZING! "
"I truly enjoyed climbing Sigiriya Rock. Got there early, and we were on our way at about 6:40 am. It’s hot here in April, so there was some serious sweating involved, but it’s not a huge hike really. Bring some water. Also we had our guide / driver with us who always has all the important stories to explain a place - really a great value add, considering there is just some rubble. I thought the entrance fee for a family of four, in excess of USD 100, quite steep, but I am glad we did it. "
"The earlier the better to beat the heat and the crowd. The entrance fee is 5310 rupee for foreigners, which is kind of pricy. It also includes Sigiriya museum that is in the same building of the ticket counter. "
"A big respect to my wife, she had fractured her ankle not long before we travelled but she made it to the top. What a climb !!!! If you are contemplating going make sure you go early in the morning otherwise the crowds are enormous, and take a bottle of water. Boots are not needed but trainers will suffice. Take your camera, excellent views from the top. Well worth a visit."
My daughter and I visited the rock at 630 in the morning. The weather is perfect for walking the rock at this time. 
"It's not just a climb up the rock but has an interesting history behind it. The climb it self was exhausting but with the short stops it helped us gain some breath. Once you reach the top, you totally forget the climb the views are just incredible. Would recommend this to everyone with a healthy heart."
My advice... do it in the morning before it gets too hot. There are steps to be climbed and it could be a challenge. Having said that it is really worth it just to be impressed with the human ingenuity that constructed such a temple. The view from the top is impressive. The frescoes that remain on the rock walls are stunning (note no photography allowed). The area is overall impressively maintained right down to the removal of the plastic wrapping from your drink bottle at the checkpoint. Your bags are also checked for any other plastic materials that could contaminate the site. A model other countries could follow. The stair case is quite safe though I can see it can become busy. The signs for hornets is advisory and definitely not an issue for us. Get there when the park opens to avoid the crowds. Certainly worth the climb. 
We were very excited to visit .. and more excited about the climb with my 6 year old. but trust me the journey was nice but the destination was not even worth the walk..
The ancient city was one of our favorite stops on our trip. The climb to the top of the rock is long but worth it. The view is incredible once you reach the top.
"What an experience it is to climb the rock. Our driver advised us to do it later in the afternoon to avoid the hottest part of the day but nevertheless, it was still nearly 30° when we climbed around 4pm. That said, it was worth it! It wasn’t as busy as some have said in previous reviews, although there were many people, we didn’t have to wait in long queues going up or down. Just the occasional pause to catch your breath and off you go again while others around you do the same. "
This area is fascinating. The museum gives a great insight into the achievements needed to creat a town on top of this rock thousands of years ago.
"Having spent 2 weeks travelling around Sri Lanka, Ella and Sigiriya had their own charms. Sigirya has alot more wildlife to offer. Many will also argue that 5000 rupees to climb the Lion's Rock is too expensive; which it is. However, if you are coming to Sigiriya then climbing the 2 large rocks is something that just has to be done! There are many steps but it is more straightforward than Pidurangala rock - just be aware that their are monkeys nearer to the top who will want to get into your backpacks!"
"We climbed the rock and where not let down, it’s best to have a guide so they can show you things and explain the history. We left our hotel at 6.10am to get to the rock as early as possible ! This was for two reasons to miss the majority of the other tourists and also to do it at the coolest time , I can highly recommend this as it a tough ascent and it gets hot an sweaty. The pain was well worth the it the view was stunning "
"I highly recommend bringing the exact amount of money you need to enter. The price is $35/person, and I dont recommend paying in their local currency as it fluctuates too much from day to day. "
"It was wonderful 
So I’m here at sri lanka together with my local boyfriend and he bring me to sigiriya and it’s was so worth it. It was so amazing as you can see all the ancients scribble and  rock formation. 

Nature is life"
We climbed it yesterday: went OK.
"We left our Sigiriya hotel early to take advantage of the cooler conditions, we drove half an hour to Sigiriya Rock Fortress, a UNESCO site that dates back to the 5th Century when established as a king's palace and fortress. It was later used as a Buddhist Monastery until the 14th Century. "
"We didn't quite make it for 6.30 as we'd hoped, but we had our tickets and were on our way before 7, and it only got crowded when we were on our way down."
"Climbing the rock of Sigiriya is an essential part of a visit to Sri Lanka and possibly the most memorable. It can be crowded and hot but experiencing the climb together with the thousands of Sri Lankan people is not to be missed. Get there early and take plenty of water. A back pack is a good idea to leave hands free as some of the climb is quite steep and exposed, although always robust and safe. There are a lot of steps but it is always crowded so the rate of climb is leisurely and does not feel strenuous for the older person. The climb itself is exciting and breathtaking, but there is also the most stunning cave art after a short stretch up a spiral staircase, and then the view from the top is marvellous."
"This site is huge: much of it is easily accessible at low level - ancient water gardens, fortifications etc. However the focus of the site is the Lion Rock and its fortress. Climbing this will be a challenge for many people. But if you think you are up to it, give it a go. It is mostly stepped, so easy-enough for the able-bodied. The views (even on a misty day) are fabulous. On the summit was a huge fortress evidence of which still remains. "
This is a tremendous site. It is the foundations of an ancient town existing BC. The main attraction is a vertical climb up a rock face to see the foundations of an ancient palace on the top. The climb is just over 1000 steps so you need to be fit and not suffer from vertigo. There are fabulous views and a stopping place two-thirds of the way up if you cannot make it to the top. It is wise to arrive early before 9.00am as it becomes very busy when coach trips arrive.
"This place is full of miracles and I Cant believe I climbed the 1200 plus steps! Such an amazing feeling when you reach the top! its hard to think how it was built at that time. It is a vast area with loads of architectural structures including ponds, Steps, Doors and many more."
The Ancient City of Sigiriya was amazing to see! But... we should have arrived earlier. When we got to the beginning of the path up it was crazy!! There were so many people pushing to get up the stairs. Mant travelers turned around and left to get out the madness. Get there early for less crazy!
I had a voucher so got the first ticket but then with my driver went to the museum which did not open till 8am so when on teh climb. Some tips take water and rest on your way if you can. Im not fit so had to rest on the way and at the top. Wonderful site and later in day returned to see the museum.
Incredible and absolutely worth the cost- as foreigners we should definitely pay more so I do not disagree with this.
The best advice I can give is to get up early and be at the ticket office when it opens at 6.30am
"We are not great explorers! However you cannot go to Sigiriya without giving the rock climb a go. As we discovered, luckily, you don't have to go all the way up but at least get yourself up to the rock paintings and lions feet. Yes it's all quite steep, getting down is harder) but take your time and go early (6:30am) to beat the crowds and heat - we were back at our accommodation nearby by about 8:30. At least you can say you did it!!"
"Finally - a UNESCO site worth the price of admission in Sri Lanka! Somehwat challenging walk - do it in the morning as the rock provides shade for most of the climb. Walk through the well-marked remains of royal gardens on way to the steps and stairs to the top. Once on top, in the midst of a medieval fortress, enjoy 360 degree views. It's a lot easier coming down. Get a pick in front of the Lion's Feet too. Nice breeze on top. Clean (relatively) bathrooms on site."
"The only point is given to the beautiful view of the lion rock, but the management of the site is absolutely TERRIBLE !!! "
My personal opinion is that Lion's rock is both easier and safer compared to Pidurangala. The view on top is amazing but it is primarily the vestiges of an ancient time that are strikingly magnificent.
"I climbed this rock with my two children ages 8 and 4. I was really concerned about the safety. Oh well, the climb is not unsafe at all. All the 1200 steps are well made. Few are bricked and others are metal stairs. They’re fenced as you go up. There are many places in between with shade where you can stop and rest. Its hot no doubt. Carry water and wear sunscreen and hats. Its gets windy as you go up so no worries. "
"Very impressive, but go as early as possible as it is very exposed and hot. We got there at 6.30 when it opens and there were a reasonable number of people there even then. When we were on the top at 8am it was very hot and obviously would be much warmer later in the day. There is little shade on the top."
My wife climbed the rock and as she is a keen rambler said the climb was not difficult at all. Lots of history of the area and well maintained gardens
"One of the highlights of our tour of Sri Lanka. The rock is a 260 metre climb, most of which is via steps on the shaded west side of the rock. "
Climbing sigiriya was one of the best thing I have ever done.It was a challenge.I did walk around the top very much and the view are breathtaking and well worth wobbly knees.It was a great sightseen in srilanka.
"Highlights: First, the walk to the top includes a wall of gorgeous frescoes as well as the incredible lion paw steps. These two stops along the hike make for welcome rest stops, and are really quite amazing! Second, the view from the top is breathtaking, and well worth the climb. Third, the monkeys were really friendly and quite adorable. They kept my spirits high as I began to run out of energy towards the top!"
1000+ steps to climb. It is best to visit early to avoid heat and crowds. View from top is fantastic.
"First of all be careful of large wasp who reside on the top of rock.!!! They attacked the people just after we left the place. few people were hospitalised, I heard. Old king has built the place. It's really worth to climb up and see the ancient paintings and the city ruins. but authorities should pay attention for preserve the paintings, and also the city ruins. Place was overall OK except the site guides on the bottom of rock and the entrance charge for tourist. site guides sometimes really annoying for tourists. someone should do something"
You want to start early as it gets hot and it gets busy. The rock does not look challenging from the base but it is hard work. Take it steady and all will be well.
"If you visited another ancient city in asian country I don’t suggest this place but if you are not it is to be missed. So hot so crowded long way to go up but when you arrive the best part is lion cave. Anything else except some ruined walls and rooms that has not clear information about the time . Elephant rock ,cobra rock shoud not to be missed."
"You need to climb 1200 steps (about 2 hours) to get to the top

No service or shaded areas

Not much to see on top"
"Get up early and get to the rock early before 9am to avoid the heat & crowds. The steep steps and climb to the top are well worth the views and experience .
Take your time going up and look back at the panoramic views!"
"although it can get pretty crowded and it is not a cheap place to visit, still I think that it is worth going there, a lot of climbing to the top compensates the breathtaking view and the remains let you think how it must have looked like in the past in its glory days"
This is an amazing sight to visit. Seen for miles around.If you manage the fairly strenuous walk/climb to the top you will not be disappointed. Its a must if your in this area but make sure you time it right. I climbed at 4.30pm just as it was getting cooler and in time to witness fantastic sunset.

"The old colonial feeling. The whole buildings,  swimming pool, restaurants, the walk along the beach and hip vibe at night."
They don't have local cuisine that we wanted to have before leaving the country. The room is very small considering the value.
Loved this hotel! The staff couldn't have been more helpful or friendly. The breakfast was amazing - probably 1 of the best buffets I have had.
It was very quiet but this was because of the recent Easter Sunday bombings
"Loved the enormous salt water pool,, and the breakfasts , especially the freshly made hoppers I usually sat a little longer with an extra pot of chai overlooking the sea,, nothing was a problem. And brilliant front desk and concierge service"
"Such a lovely stay at the hotel. We arrived just after the terrible news on Colombo and despite having army personnel around the hotel, the staff were so amazing at making us feel safe and at ease. As it was our honeymoon, the staff upgraded our room and sent bubbles and chocolates to our room which was a lovely touch. The room service was also so prompt and tasty. We’re planning on returning in the future to spend more time here. Thank you to everyone at the Galle Face for being so lovely at a time of tragedy for Sri Lanka."
"The breakfast was incredible, the staff beyond helpful and the bedrooms were lovely. It was a truly great stay and I would definitely stay again."
"I don't have a bad word to say about the Galle Face Hotel, we loved every minute."
The history is amazing and the place is huge and beautifully presented. the pool is great and th eoptions for drinks and food are really good. Location is also perfect.
Nothing
"Staying here made for a wonderful first night in Sri Lanka. A gorgeous historic building that has been looked after so well. Lovely rooms, incredible evening buffet eaten under the stars, a fun Cuban bar on site to watch the sunset and a lovely clean pool. Wonderful location too!"
Nothing!
"Breakfast was very good and varied as would have been expected from a 5 star hotel. Bed was comfortablePool was excellent overlooking the sea - lovely to relax and hear the waves lapping. Staff were incredible helpful and always willing to help even organising a taxi for us at the end for the airport. We did not use the hotel's cars which would have cost $70 to the airport and instead used  Kangroo Cabs which cost 3000 rupees."
"For what we paid, I was expecting a nicer room. Although we got one of the cheapest rooms, we still paid £165 a night for a basic room and breakfast - with a view over a unused courtyard and building which had paint peeling off its walls.  We had stayed in much nicer rooms throughout our stay, but I understand that you are paying for the location and to stay in a piece of history. One night we went to the hotels Cuban restaurant, My partner is vegan and even though vegan options were given, the food was bland and tasteless and we ended up spending £28 for 4 small plates and 2 mock-tails. I would not recommend eating there!"
"Beautiful colonial hotel close to the seafront. Wonderfully restored to its former beauty. Great spacious and well-appointed rooms, excellent breakfast and dinner. Superlative staff with great service!"
"Perhaps a little pricy, but worth it."
"An amazing place to stay in Colombo- friendly staff, incredible food, plenty of history to enjoy in a place that oozes style and takes you back in time.  Definitely recommend it!"
nothing- I wish I could afford to stay there longer!!!
The greeting was great the room was good. Complementary fridge and a great house keeper. Loved the salt water pool.
Holes in pool decking that could cause injury
The property is beautiful and the staff is amazing and they even bring you fresh water bottles and fruit in the swimming poll. The breakfast is great.
Rooms are old but well mantained. Could use an update. We had a balcony and what we could see: another building...
"This place is a living heritage museum, celebrating bygone eras. Staying here is a must on your visit to Sri Lanka. The building is beautiful and classic, the service friendly and helpful, the food and drinks delicious. I strongly recommend having sundowner drinks in the courtyard and watching the bagpiper play as the Sri Lankan flag is lowered at sunset - what a remarkable experience!"
The hotel is an iconic place. So much history! En joy the historic tour of the hotel to get the best historic insight of the property.
Pity the harbour and big buildings are coming towards the hotel...
A wonderful hotel in every sense enhanced by fantastic staff. Colonial style with grand staircases and wood panelling. Staying here is a unique experience. There are plenty of marble palaces nearby but once inside you could be in any city in the world. The Galle Face Hotel is Colombo.
Nothing to dislike.
The staff. The welcome and check in process. Having complimentary minibar items and welcome snacks. The happy hour snacks were delicious. The ocean view from the room along with the sound of waves crashing on the property's beach. The outside seating area of the restaurants by the beach. The suite size. The TV was big.
"The hotel is old but not in a charming way. It looks like it needs renovation. The carpets need replacement (they look dirty), the wood needs polishing and the wall needs painting. Some areas of the hotel smelled like sewers and some of the towels in the toilet looked so worn out."
"The hotel is very colonial - it literally breathes the history of older times. It is truly one of the main places to see in Colombo, we highly recommend it for a stay in the city. We stayed for one night on our way back home and we really regreted not staying there longer.The staff are AMAZING - welcoming, helpful, discreet. You truly feel the luxury and the tradition of quality. This hotel is a city within a city - there are so many things you can do - 4 amazing restaurants, splendid front line sea view pool with salt water, bars with an exciting selection of drinks, spa area, museum (how crazy is that?!:)), wime cellar.. Special thanks to the manager who gave us an upgrade and a complimentary early check-in. We were surprised that the hotel managed to overcome our expectations! Will definitely stay again."
I liked the food. The burger was excellent on the veranda. We also went to the 1864 French restaurant and the steaks were very good. Service was impeccable and all in all a great experience and end to our holiday.
Curtains weren’t quite fitting the windows which was annoying in the morning.
Huge room and you can hear the waves when you open the windows. Great breakfast and iconic sunset
"The hotel is a bit tired and our room looked like t hadn’t been used in a while. The staff was very quick in fixing it, but We let we had better experience in significantly cheaper places."
Old colonial hotel with memories of days gone by!
"Our room was in a wing on the side, however the passage was noisy with people walking and we could hear doors banging! It is a beautiful old quaint colonial hotel, as such the floor creek etc"
Have stayed here many times. The hotel has refurbished and improved consistently over the years. I can't imagine staying somewhere else in Colombo.
"The room was great the staff was friendly and professional. We had high tea with invited friends rather than dinner which was fantastic.
"
Nothing. Everything was perfect.
"Nice, big hotel with history. Beautiful terrace to enjoy a drink. Breakfast was vast and lovely. Nice pool overlooking the ocean."
Our room was okay but not as beautiful as where we stayed before here. 
"Great location, just a few metres from Fort wall and beach with views of wall and beach from balcony. Generous and tasty breakfast.
Friendly hosts who kindly offered to do a load of washing for us at no additional fee."
Nothing
"An exceptional colonial hotel with up to the second amenities. Wonderful staff providing excellent service.  Great choice of food and drinks, a truly fantastic place to stay in Sri Lanka. "
If you can fault this hotel in any way I’d be utterly surprised. 
Everything about this beautiful hotel is perfect. The staff are wonderful. The breakfast is superb and the atmosphere/buildings are excellent. I will always return here when I come back to Colombo!
The location right on the water is stunning.  It was lovely to sit by the pool and overlook the ocean and have the waves crashing right there.  It doesn't get much more beautiful than this.  It is also very close to any restaurant or site you want to visit in Colombo.  The buffet breakfast was also quite delicious.  The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay.
"Galla Face is a total refuge from the chaos that is Columbo. Lovely setting and sunset views, kind and very attentive staff, very good food - breakfast will be an abiding memory of our trip. The hotel is old school elegance and calm. It’s a big place but never feels frenetic or over busy. You feel slightly like you’re in an episode of Jewel in the Crown - a real experience and we were delighted to top and tail our Sri Lanka trip here."
"Honestly, not a thing."
"Liked the always helpful staff. The location was excellentTheir Fine dinning restaurant was superb"
NOISE....late night loud Thump Thump music from lower floor ...which made me angry as on booking I specified a quiet room ..the hotel replied and said for my 3 night stay I would have a quiet room...it wasn’t quiet at all. Buffet restaurant needs an overhaul on food selection and presentation.
Really enjoyed our stay. The amount of food to choose from in the buffet was amazing. Staff very helpful and friendly. Room was good and pool area very nice.
A room with a balcony would have been nice but overall good
The hotel was everything i expected. I was there for the Ironman race and i was welcomed the minute i stepped in the door despite turning up with my bike and all my kit. The rooms are great. The hotel is steeped in history and this is reflected in every aspect of the place. I would highly recommend it when you are in Colombo. I fell asleep to the sound of the sea!!
"nothing, i loved it"
"Location, swimming pool, atmospheric old colonial hotel, with a wonderful museum over the history of the hotel. The sunset, the lowering of the Sri Lankan flag at sunset."
"It was a very different experience of living in old colonial hotel on the coast of a bustling city of Colombo.  I did not have too much opportunity to explore the city (I only saw if from the window of the car going to work), instead I took the time to explore the hotel itself and it was an adventure.  For those of you who enjoy historical places, this hotel has a lot to offer!  It is worth to talk to the staff members about the history of the place an some slightly quirky rituals that the guests will surely witness :).   Even if the hotel itself is over 150 years old, it offeres all modern facilities.  I greatly appreciated the fact that the rooms are equipped with old-fashioned ceiling fans as well as the air conditioning.   This way I had a choice not to use the later and still stay cool in the room.  The breakfast buffet is excellent with a large choice of diverse dishes - both local, Western and also some Oriental.   Overally it is a good hotel for those, who want to stay in a place which is differnet from the modern Western style business hotels."
"Beautiful old colonial hotels. Great facilities, lovely big pool. Nice pool bar and Cuban restaurant. Drinks quite pricey compared to other hotels we stayed at in Sri Lanka.
Huge bedroom."
Silly light system all controlled from a key pad that you can’t see in the night! Difficult to find a light switch to actually turn on! Air con was also difficult to use and so our room hot overnight.
"The ambience of the historic past, the building, the rooms, the location - all great"
"Many groups of tourists, and the fact that the hotel misses a few ‘younger’ propositions - Cuban bar a good start... terrace area, long room can do with more of the same.... how can you make the hotel more interesting for younger  clientele?!
"
"Again an old colonial style hotel . Rooms we stayed in were tired and a bit rough around the edges, I believe they are in the process of updating the rooms.With tax and service charge added on , prices for drinks, spa treatments and food were similar to western hotel prices. Nice salt water pool.Pool bar area good for watching sunsets, Sri Lankan piper announces sunset , and sri lankan flag  lowered overnight.Good breakfast buffets."
"Some mildew and fungus on wood in bathroom ,  manager told us  he would move us, but hotel full . Didn""t here any more from him and remained in same room. However they did scrape above off the wood !"
"There was a fantastic welcome as we arrived in the morning the staff went out of their way to get our room ready earlier so we didn't have to wait until check in. Everyone was very friendly and provided fantastic customer service, nothing was too much trouble. Thank you for making the start of my holiday in Sri Lanka one to remember."
"With a short notice, the hotel arrange to send me a vehicle to the airport to pick me up."
"In the check-in, the staff in the front desk assigned me  a room which is less than what I paid for.Upon bringing this issue to management, I was giving the right one."
Swimming pool and restaurants The Verandah and the Cuban by the sea
"Room was on 4th floor in one corner facing a tower with a soldier with weapon. It was big but old, bathroom had a leak. Old room old aisle."
Fantastic historic hotel. First class accommodation.  Pillows / bed great. View of property & ocean sensational. Breakfast buffet very nice.  Staff plentiful. Pool excellent.  Cheap tuk tuk to markets or shops in Colombo.
Can’t think of any.
On the seafront but unable to swim in the sea.  Very efficient and friendly staff. Ok location. Access to many local hotel restaurants.  Complementary soft drinks and snacksin the room fridge. Hotel Cuban bar lively with good cocktails. 30m swimming pool with salt water. Spa and gym facilities good.
"No view from our room. Lots of building projects nearby, but this did not affect our hotel stay."
"Colonial grandeur - a delight to stay in this beautiful heritage building with such a rich history. Gin and tonic on the beachfront, a swim in the pool and a Sri Lankan curry buffet for dinner. Heaven! I never opened a door the whole time I stayed there. Staff were very attentive and friendly."
There was not a single thing to complain about.
"The staff were great, nothing was a problem. The breakfast is fantastic. The pool is clean and amazing spot for watching the sunset "
The lunch wasn’t great 
"A historical and traditional hotel, beautiful place and wondelful property. The renovation is made very well, they have not destroyed the feeling of the palace. The room was big and well equipped. The staff is professional. We got very good dinners in the special restaurants and the selection of wines is huge."
"We had to wait more than half an hour before we got the room even that we arrived after 2 in the afternoon. They just forgot us sitting on the sofa. The buffetrestaurant is too big and restless, it was not nice to have at least breakfast there."
"We were very impressed with the check-in service. We arrived slightly early and were able to check-in after a short wait. The hotel is beautiful, in a perfect sea-front location and feels like stepping back into a long-gone colonial era. The room (junior suite) was beautifully appointed with two sea-view balconies, a feature jacuzzi bath and very comfortable bed."
"Unfortunately we were disappointed by the restaurant experience. We were staying at the hotel to mark a special occasion and I had made a dinner reservation at the Verandah at the time of booking. Upon arriving at the restaurant we were informed that it was buffet only that night (no a la carte) due to a private function in another restaurant. I felt the hotel could have communicated this at the time of booking, which would have given me the opportunity to make alternative arrangements. It also created issues for bathroom use as the usual bathrooms were off limits due to the private function, so we had to go up to L1 for the bathroom, which caused a further inconvenience to us and was disruptive to our special dinner. I felt the hotel prioritized the private function at the expense of other guests' experience, and I have to say this is not what I expected from this hotel. In addition, the buffet itself was not great, so what was supposed to be a special evening was a disappointment."
Love the location by the sea. Friendly staff. Amazing breakfast buffet.  Great massage at the spa.
Was offered a rubbish room with noisy road outside. I was upgraded after a little time so it worked out ok in the end.
"This beautiful, stylish hotel had no faults in my opinion; the restaurants and bars are diverse and excellent, the staff are charming and helpful, the building is magnificent  and even the small museum (housing, aming other things The Duke of Edinburgh's first ever car!). The museum also lists some of the previous guests at the hotel, including Cole Porter, Mark Twain, Noel Coward, Laurenve Olivier, Duke Ellington and Scarlett Johansson.  There's not much to be said for Colombo, so it's just as well that you feel like hanging around the hotel all day!"
"We came in late desk duty were very curtious and efficient, bell staff were the same and then on top of that we were upgraded to a sea view suite wonderful way to wake up in the morning.Thankyou"
Old colonial style atmosphere. Bedroom comfortable and beautiful.
"No view whatsoever from bedroom.Slow service in bar area during lunch time. Quality of food served during the various buffet services and the seating ambiance of the restaurant could be much better."
Despite being a large hotel the staff still make it feel very friendly. The fact that the hotel has its own seafront and has retained its sense of its history makes it feel quite special.  The hotel catering was excellent.
"The best hotel in Colombo, and probably in all  Sri Lanka
Colonial atmosphere,  perfect service, and excellent breakfast"
Cost much more than the alternatives
"The bathroom was perfect, the room very comfortable, even had views. The pool and pool area was wonderful."
Breakfast not included. Otherwise there was nothing to not like!
Airport pick up service was excellent.  Beautiful breakfast on the veranda. Tried the Siri Lankan specialities.   Had great tea with pastries.
Our stay was to short.
"This hotel is over 150 years old and it is well reflected in the overal ambience.  For travellers who like hotels with the difference, it is a very pleasant experience.   Even a tour around the hotel is like sightseeing.   I also liked the location.  Right by the sea [althought the beach is not large], a great position to watch sunsets.  It is also close to a busy city promenade where you can immerse yourself in Colombo's life, so different from the slightly posh atmosphere of the hotel.Breakfast it very good.  A wide range - local and European food.  Very fresh and tasty.  Meals are served on the verandah which allows to feel the warmth and sea breeze.   Hotel has few bars, including a latino bar with life music.  The rooms have fans as well as air conditioners.  Fans are bit noisy sometimes, but for those who can't stand air conditioning this is a good alternative.  Staff is very helpful and patient.  Like everywhere in Sri Lanka.  Overall, definitely a very pleasant experience."
Sometimes I felt I was getting too much attention.   But this is just a cultural difference :)
"Beautiful historical hotel that has been well maintained. The location, staff, facilities (especially the pool) were all fantastic and deserving of the 5 star rating. Thank you for such a wonderful stay. "
Nothing! 
"Galle Face Hotel is one of the iconic hotels of the past and lives up to its reputation. Compares to Raffles, Eastern & Oriental and Peninsular hotels."
My only criticism is that Colombo itself does not provide enough interest to support a lengthy stay at the hotel.
"Everything you’d expect to find in an historic hotel like this. Staff amazing, great facilities, room well presented and restaurants/bar good too. Enjoyed our stay!"
"Unfortunately some ants had made there way into the mini bar, but this was quickly rectified by house keeping and the contents replaced (so not really an issue). "
"I’m struggling to think of positives. The hotel was ok, nothing special stands out."
"The waiting staff were sometimes attentive and other times completely ignored you. It was really hit and miss. We stayed in 8 other hotels during our tour of Sri Lanka and experienced far better service elsewhere.
The food is overpriced and mediocre. Again we had much better food elsewhere on our Sri Lankan travels for less than half the price.
The pool is small for a hotel of this size and there are not enough sun beds.
The room appeared clean at first glance, but look again and you can see that the rug hadn’t been hovered etc.
We could also hear noises from outside which disturbed our sleep.
We will look to book elsewhere next time we are in Colombo and I would advise you do the same. I couldn’t recommend this hotel."
"Great location by the water, equipped with a gym, spa and pool.  Love the Veranda area! Love the breakfast spread! Service with a smile! "
If staying during the week of national day beware of parade and celebrations that result in road blocks in the morning til lunch time.  If you arrange for driver I find they themselves along with hotel do lot know how bad traffic will be or when Road will clear.
Very grand hotel. Historical features still in place. Good selection of bars and restaurants on site. Nice pool size which was not over crowded. Staff were attentive and well mannered.
"Noise from room above very loud due to wooden flooring and furniture if moved above and also noise in corridor travels very far. Room was small, basic and in need of a touch up especially considering the grandeur of the hotel."
"This is an historic and elegant hotel which is fully updated while retaining much of its historic character. It is in a stunning position right on the coast.  The staff are plentiful and accommodating, food is good and there are a number of restaurants to choose from, breakfast was an extensive buffet featuring european and Sri Lankan dishes.  We used the hotel three times as a base in Colombo on our trip and would use it again"
"One of the rooms we stayed in, while having great views, was situated above a bar which played music late at night.  On the plus side, when we complained to the management about our disturbed night, they acted promptly to ensure that we were given a quiet room for our next night at the hotel."
Very good breakfast buffet. Helpful smiling staff. Good location. Easy to get passing taxis and tuk tuks. Interesting little museum with Prince Phillip's car. Attractive general areas.
Awful bare unattractive small room. Only one bedside light. Basic overhead shower. No bath. Tiny bottles of cheap shampoo etc. Room not cleaned by 4 pm so just obtained replacement towels from passing cleaner. Towels thin and frayed.  Bar food was served cold and soggy
All the magnificence of a grand colonial hotel. This property is well maintained with modern facilities but retains its grandeur & elegance.
Gluten Free bread was disappointing.
the breakfast spread was vast and really good! the view from the pool-side bar & dining is simply spectacular
"floor boards were creaking :) it was charming for us, not sure about the neighbors on the below floor!"
Fantastic old hotel in excellent location. Comfortable bed in lovely large room. Overall the hotel seems caught between being an axclusive first class hotel and a mass market offer. Loved the sea views and the history of the place. Sense of fading grandeur.
Air conditioning in room could not be adjusted. Very noisy and much too cold. Bathroom ok but in need if upgrade to be first class. The hotel falls between premier and mass market. It would need an upgrade to be the former but is too expensive to work as the latter.
"Bar and restaurants were excellent,  especially the Cuban bar.  The love music the was fantastic!!"
"Rooms were a bit dated, but designed to look authentic for time period. "
"Great food, good service, lovely historical feel of the hotel.Pool and location cannot be better!"
"We had a very annoying check-in at 1am in the morning (room not ready and had to wait until 2am) - however, manager apologized next day"
amazing views/location and front of house facilities - Restaurant/breakfast on site - Simply stunning !
The bedrooms ! very ol/tired and in need of a refresh
I’ve stayed there several times and always loved the old colonial style and rated it v highly . Vg cocktails and staff too
"Since last year I feel it had gone down hill . They kindly upgraded my room so no complaints but glad only there one night as view over back and roof tops and room nothing to pontificate about , so no major advantage ,whereas before I had a view over sea, front and Galle face green. Also little things like soap dish chipped in bathroom, lighting not great. Breakfast buffet deteriorated , choice more limited and had run out of emmental cheese which one doesn’t expect of hotel of this calibre No idea about dinner buffet . Dined at Cuban restaurant instead but sad seaspray had gone. Overall seems a bit scruffy compared to my previous stays."
"The ambience of this place and the attention to detail was extraordinary. The Royal Dutch suite was truly luxurious with views over the water, and the complimentary chocolates to recognise wedding anniversary, as well as upgrade to access pre-dinner champagne and canapes in the Long Room, while watching a beautiful sunset was truly memorable. The swimming pool and pool service was second to none. The Library is well worth a visit too. Wished we could have stayed longer..."
Nothing at all.
"Pleasant dinning, great staff, good location. Good live band one night."
"Paid for a deluxe queen room. Room was small,view of a dirty ally-way,and showed its age.,"
"Colonial history, design and location. Cuban restaurant was excellent and great fun with excellent staff"
"The evening we were there there was a major corporate event which dominated the main ding area and bar area. The majority of the terrace was closed to residents and the music was over bearing and far too intrusive.It is quite simply that paying guest enjoyment should be compromised in this way. We should have been warned and the room rate reduced as we were unable to use all the facilities advertised and the event took over the whole outside area.The outside bar area lacks atmosphere and just doesn't feel right when it should be brilliant. More thought is needed on the detail to create a truly colonial feel.I do not think buffet service for Dinner in the main terrace restaurant is what one expects of a international hotel. Bit like being at a Club Med resort."
"We had a wonderful stay in the Galle Face during pre-christmas time. A fantastic feeling in the traditional house. Scenic view, friendly staff and beautiful colonial style decoration. Love it!"
"The room was a bit oldish decorated for such a traditional house it is a pitty. The food was average, with a bit too much Sri Lankan taste."
"The location of the landmark hotel is brilliant. as well as the history. The management is there poor. Rather uncomfortable for the lady travellers. No personal touch, no guest relation appointed managers we met. no welcome we have experienced. as much as we regret."
Location is brilliant as well as an atmosphere of the landmark hotel and the ambience. When service is missing....
The old world charm but still new looking.
I booked through booking.com. Reception somehow missed that I had alreadypaid for 2 of the 3 rooms I’d booked and accidentally charged twice for one room. This could have easily been avoided if record keeping was done well. There was unnecessary hassle caused at check out.
Gorgeous heritage property thar takes you back in time. Delightfully luxurious as well and stunning location.
Can’t think of anything other than a temporary mix up about our booking at check in. Communications between booking.com and the hotel should’ve been clearer and more prompt.
Excellent location very comfortable and clean. Staff very accommodating. Colonial Architecture just Brilliant. Loved breakfast on the veranda. Drinks in the Evening at the alfresco Cuban bar a must .
Air conditioning wasn’t working properly in our room however the technicians fixed the problem almost immediately.
Fabulous location and a very comfortable and stylish hotel.  Works as a place to relax as well as visit the city.
"The reception desk were a bit unwelcoming - it was sunset and the hotel has a tradition of 'piping' down the sun which is fun to view.  Our receptionist messed around and never said 'welcome' and we pretty much missed it.  Poor training for a hotel of such quality, but I stress that wasnt true of all the reception staff."
"Location - you can walk nearly to every landmark in the city. 
The swimming pool nearly at the beach. 
Choice of restaurants and bars (yet the speed of service could be improved, especiallly at King of the Mambo!)
Friendly and helpfull staff!
You should try the spa offer, especially the massage (ask for firm tratment and leave really relaxed)"
"Room was rather loud, mainly due to not sound proofed doors, with a lot of noises coming from the corridor - source were guests but also housekeeping employees, active early morning (6-8 AM) - we couldn’t sleep well
Bad smell as a result of humidity (in the room and some of the public spaces)
The price of airport pick-up / drop-off servcie is above average (even comparing to the Blacklane package of comparable car standard)"
"Location is very central and unique as the garden is directly on the seafront (most other main hotels are separated by the main road). The swimming pool is spacious (40 m) & uses sea water. Direct view of sunset. 
Breakfast spread is varied and well presented. The common areas have maintained some of the original style of this historic hotel. Excellent clean & modern gym. "
Rooms Are a bit dated and would need an upgrade. Wooden floors tend to be noisy despite carpet flooring. 
Manager was not welcoming or service-oriented when receiving us at the hotel and discussing the room rates. Not the gracious service typical of 5 star properties.
"Facilities and decoration transport you to the early 20th century. Pool, restaurant and bars are well decorated and are perfect to spend days, weeks, months"
"Elevators on the back section could be better maintained. Other than that, there’s nothing else I didn’t like"
"Beautiful Colonial-era building, everything was immaculate and food was excellent. The whole look, feel and atmosphere was wonderful. Rooms are decorated in keeping with the era. Service is top class."
Room rate was fairly high but it was peak Christmas & New Year season so to be expected I suppose.
Right on the sea front. The building holds so many historical features and it is beautiful.
The meals and drinks menu is not clear about tax not being included so final bill almost doubles.
Good terrace overlooking the water for food and cocktails
Wasn’t allocated the room I requested. The room smelled of damp and little concern showed by staff to resolve. Eventually I was moved but not without a fight which was a real shame.
Property itself was beautiful and the staff very nice
"Taxes are not included in the room rate or any of the menus, when booking this should be clearer as was much more expensive than advertised. "
"The location is great, easy to walk to the old Dutch hospital development, or the shops at Crescat. A short tuk tuk ride to Barefoot, Paradise Rd and The Gallery Cafe."
Nothing.
"it’s a beautiful old hotel and fun. With lots of friendly efficient staff. Chanaka on reception particularly helpful. I needed him to print a contract, to sign and then them to scan it back to me... which they did without fuss and very quickly 😀"
"Nothing.. it’s a beautiful old hotel and fun. With lots of friendly efficient staff. Chanaka on reception particularly helpful. I needed him to print a contract, to sign and then them to scan it back to me... which they did without fuss and very quickly 😀"
"A wonderful historical experience. Charming and elegant. The real Surprise was the King of Mambo downstairs and outside on the lawn. It is a must for any visitor. great atmosphere, food and setting, and lounges."
nothing
Good hotel for our short stay in Colombo. Great location as very close to local Laksalas for shopping and to other tourist spots.
Room was not well-lit
A nostalgic visit had not been to Galle Face since 1959/60 or thereabouts. The resident historian gave a run down on the changes since then. 
Nothing to say all good
"It is  a great hotel. The service, the staff, the look and fell...  Everything is simply excellent."
"The only downside is that it is fits for couples. If the staying is surfing purposes, I would not recommend stay there (especially with kids - the hotel doesn't fit for kids).If you have honeymoon or just want to relax as a couple, this is exactly the place to do so!!!"
"Beautiful setting, traditional colonial style really enjoyed our stay. Food and drink reasonably priced for this star hotel. We were upgraded to a suite which was amazing."
"Dirty bath, black bits in water when Jacuzzi was used "
"The hotel's charm is unparalleled. The location is unbeatable. Old world hospitality, lovely nooks and crannies across the property and lovingly preserved traditions. Great front desk experience."
"Still scope for improvement in housekeeping services, room upkeep. Hotel cab rates are way above normally paid around Colombo. Tighter management overall will help."
Great location and colonial vibe
Food at beach bar was very average. Chicken satay served undercooked and slightly pink. Staff very helpful and ordered again but still under cooked.
"The heritage hotel is a realGem. Loved aperil spritz on the verandah viwwimng the sunset and the taking down of the flag with bagpipes in tow. Truly moving"
Nothing
"1. All extra comfy!2. Scent of the hotel!3. staff always brings you in person when you are lost! 4. Hotel car always ready in a span of short call 5. Concierge really looks after your messages6. All smile happy staff7. Relax environment8. Management runs towards you when there is an issue not run away fromyou9. The old wood floor10.  The black and white photos in the museum who visited the hotel since it opened.  Including so many royal families and politicians and US presidents and James Bond actors 11.  Sunset ceremony12. the breeze"
"additional telephone for bigger rooms and I have to run to answer the phone.  If I was sleeping, I cannot go back to sleep coz I had to answer the door or the phone by the time I go back to bed I am awake!  Need Chargers at the bar!  Sound system improvement and spa needs improvement"
"Has so much potential to be a great hotel. However the building is run down, customer service staff have very little concept on what they are doing and at times rude and unhelpful. Food selection in restaurants was poor. Seems to cater for a primarily middle age British holiday maker demographic with pre purchased holiday packages.Also had an awful experience with some missing jewellery that had been delivered for us from another hotel. Galle Face have refused to accept any responsibility for this despite it going missing whilst in their care. We will pursuing this legally."
The British Raj at its absoloute best.
"It didn't bother us but seeing as a question about the beach appeared, you couldn't bathe, but it was no issue at all to us as the pool was magnificent"
"Location, historic building and staff"
Room description on booking.com differed to hotel website. We were moved after 2 days but made to feel as if we were complaining when we actually only wanted the suite we thought we had booked.
It’s got great character and the restaurant is very good with good variety of evening meals. Breakfast was ok. Staff are fantastic. Beds are very comfy. Great location to go walking and exploring. Plenty of tuktuks outside if you want to go anywhere.
It’s an old building so you can hear people moving around on the floor above which can wake you up. Room smelt a little musty or damp but nothing major. 
"Beautiful historic building. Wonderful dining. Buffet at breakfast was a great variety and huge buffet. English, Sri Lankan and to order eggs any style. Nice drink selection and pool. Wonderful place to recover during an extended journey. "
Our room was noisy from a wedding below us. (They moved us immediately no problem. Very service oriented). 
The staff were very kind to us when we arrived very early in the morning after a long flight and found us a room to occupy by mid morning at no extra cost.
Nothing at all.
"Loved the Long room for canapés and drinks in the evening. Breakfast was amazing. The staff could not have been more helpful. We had suites on the fourth floor overlooking the ocean, they were very quiet rooms."
Everything. It’s a lovely colonial style hotel. With seniority and elegance. The Cuban bar is great. I will definitely repeat if I go back to Colombo.
"Nothing, everything was great"
"We liked the Genius Loci of this place, the proffessional service, great breakfast, possition, the pool, lobby and the bar."
"We believe that the superior room we had needs refurbishing, it is quite worn out for a 5 star superior room"
Classic old colonial feel. Really nice bar/terrace area
Rooms are old fashioned - not necessarily a criticism but some people might want a more modern bathroom etc
"Friendly, courteous and helpful staff. Excellent choice of food in Verandah restaurant. Breakfast was superb and bar snacks were delicious.  Good choices for dinner.Room very comfortable and fresh fruit offered along with free non alcoholic drinks in fridge"
Nice grounds and beautiful old building.  In general staff extremely nice.  Buffet breakfast and lunch were very good.
"Booked connecting rooms 8 months in advance, upon arrival we were told the interconnecting rooms are small and unsuitable, ended up in two separate rooms and had to split our young children between rooms.  If they’d told me that 8 months in advance I would have cancelled the booking.  Ended up being a disaster of a two night stay and they didn’t seem to care at all.  Rooms are old and tired with archaic control systems.  Staff were nice but service was agonisingly slow even by Sri Lankan standards.  Terrible value for money compared to other hotels in the city, you’re paying for the history of the place more than anything else."
For historians a delight this old and famous hotel. Some of the rituals (such as an unusual ceremony every sunset) were very enjoyable.
"The rooms' bathroom needed some maintenance, but upon return to the hotel some days later all were very apologetic and a free upgrade was granted."
"The colonial charm of the hotel and its location overlooking the ocean, which was perfect for watching sunsets. Also, the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. A bonus was the quality and variety of food served at the buffets."
The room was a little small and there was a step up to get into the bathroom which could be a bit hazardous in the dead of night.
"Very comfortable as one expects with a 5* hotel of this stature. Lovely staff, quick & helpful at reception, excellent breakfast! Interesting to meet the gentleman doorman who has 52 years service with the hotel. "
"Some more sunshine would have been good to try out the pool, but nothing the hotel can control! 
"
I am a repeat customer.  I find this hotel ideal.
"The beds in the old wing can be a little small, and the bathroom has a window into the room, making light blocking difficult."
"Beautiful views, friendly waiting staff and great breakfasts. "
"Noise. Wooden floors and noisy people in the room upstairs meant I was woken at 1.15am on the first night and a party until 2.30am on the second night led to bad nights sleep. The spa was a bit disorganised and deep tissue massage was not deep tissue and not very good. 
Avoid if you want to sleep. I checked out a day early and management response was pretty poor. "
As hotels around the world slowly become indistinguishable from each other this hotel is unique full of surprises and as helpful and friendly as you can be. I loved it and I'm coming back.
"Beautiful building, furnishings and setting."
"The noise of people in the room above (wooden floors).The service from the hotels booking team, who rather than honour their advertised get three nights for two deal which wasn't working on their website, just removed it."
"The breakfast buffet is incredible. The walk from the room to the restaurant beside the beach is fantastic. Very relaxing atmosphere in the middle of busy city.We stayed here for our honeymoon and the special attention they brought to the presentation of the room was wonderful. Great service !"
"Beautiful colonial style hotel. Great wooden floors and historic fittings and furnishings.
Rooms are comfy with upmarket /old school feel. Pool is excellent with an amazing view of the ocean.
Location is great to get to some of the points of interest in Colombo.
Buffet breakfast has a great selection.
Also shout out to the pool bar staff who got us some buffalo curd and tikal even though it wasn't on the menu. "
Nothing really. Parts of the hotel exterior need a bit of TLC 
"This hotel truly lives up to its reputation as the finest hotel east of the suez. We checked in last minute, as an addition to our honeymoon travels and we were so glad we did! Amazing location, decor, staff, facilities and food. Would definitely recommend the Galle Face to anyone travelling in Sri Lanka."
"The building is fantastic. The hotel has really that classic stylish look.
Rooms are clean.
Breakfast is excellent."
"There is many staff around, however they’re not that focused on service and creating that special atmosphere. Eg waiting times for checking in and out are much too long.
The area around the hotel is dramatically changing.
Hotel is slightly overpriced for what you really get. It’s not that special experience I hoped to get."
"Staff were very friendly but not overly helpful. Swimming pool was amazing. The pool bar is also great for snacks and drinks almost any time of day. 
The building itself is just gorgeous. The galle face green is right next door and is a great spot to take in a sunset and sea breeze. 
The fort district is only a short walk and there is a shopping mall across the road. "
"The room wasn't as clean as it could have been. A pair of false eyelashes left in the shower were waiting for us the first time we used it. 
We called reception three times for assistance we never did receive. 
Price gouging when leaving. Don't ask for a taxi they will provide the hotel car for more than double the price of an actual taxi. Take an uber using the hotels Wi-Fi instead. "
"The whole hotel is an experience from beginning to end. Just walking around this beautiful hotel is like sight seeing in museum.  Their traditions such as the 6 oclock piper from the hotel to the shore, the two weddings we were lucky enough to watch.  All perfect.  Just one little problem.  The door between rooms (locked) did nothing to stop the noise next door.  We could hear teaspoons clinking, conversations, etc.  Luckily for us we had two considerate neighbours.  Not sure how that noise could be reduced.  Guess next time I would definitely ask for a room with no shared door.  However this is a beautiful hotel , on an amazing point of land in Colombo so make sure to go there (and ask for a room without door)"
Only the shared door probem
"We returned to this fabulous colonial oasis after 36 years and it was more wonderful than before. The hotel is charming and is a reminder of a bygone era.  The staff are very much up to date about the importance of friendly, efficient service and are able to communicate extremely well with travellers from all over the world. A smile goes a long way and there are certainly many of those from the hotel staff.  The restaurants, bar, pool, museum and grounds are top notch and make for a very romantic interlude in a very busy city.  My husband and I highly recommend The Galle Face Hotel."
Leaving
"The location, unique
The atmosphere, timeless
The hospitality, formal yet warm and unobtrusive
The seawater swimming pool
And now the spa..."
"Nothing, I am always satisfied with the best"
We were placed in an (upgraded) room above thumping music that kept us awake. 'Just till 11.30pm' we were told when we called reception. Appalling at these prices! We had to demand a change of room in the middle of the night - very inconvenient. Never again!
Well preserved colonial relic 
F&B staff at buffet area needs to be more proactive; the young trainees at Reception desk need better training and improve on their customer service attitude 
"almost everything was perfect. the beach front location. the heritage elegant property. the beautiful artefacts. the gorgeous beach front pool bar. the little private beach. the creative nooks & corners ... overall a dream stay ! would like to mention the team members Sampath at airport, Lalith & Sajid at the long room, manoranjan on floors, dannika at the verandah, Amila the front office supervisor & Malitha at reception & of course Mr Sadique.  So many others I dont have the names. they create awesome experiences for guests !"
"need more lights in the room and also light above the bathroom mirror. 
a lady at front desk called Nasheetha was quite rude & not helpful. "
"the hotel is the best place I have ever stayed at - the view from the room, the hoppers for breakfast and the sunset on the patio are incomparable - thanks"
"This is a fantastic hotel for a splurge. Yes, there are more affordable hotels in Colombo, but you need a night here to experience all the Dutch colonial charm. The staff were so accommodating, great rooms, amazing food and a wonderful experience."
This hotel is full of old world charm and the experience was fantastic.  The staff throughout and very helpful and pleasant.  Great location.  Would definitely recommend.
The room was a bit small.  We had an ocean view room with balcony but the cushions on the outside chairs were filled with rain water and there were no towels to use the outside lounges (though they soon arrived when requested).  The fridge did not work very well.
"The hotel was in a great location and had a lot of charm,  The staff were great - especially those who welcomed us on our arrival at 3am!"
Just outside the door to our room were all the spare beds/mattresses.  This was not a good look.
"Beautiful property which is built ON the beach, so you can hear the waves from almost everywhere in the hotel. So it gives you an unmatched resort vibe while still being located in the heart of Colombo city. They have preserved the grand heritage of the hotel very appropriately, we stayed in a 42 Sq.m junior suite with a huge private balcony facing the ocean. It doesn’t get better than that."
"The staff were a little lazy. People didn’t offer to help with luggage on both instances which was very surprising to me. The food also was acceptable but not a smack out of the park as one would have expected at a big 5 star in Colombo. Afternoon high tea at the veranda must be the most beautiful tea spot in Colombo. However the tea choices were disgraceful. Air conditioning in the room could have been a little more powerful, I suspect like most hotels they reduced the airflow between 2-5am."
What can one say about the Galleface Hotel that has not being previously said. This is an exceptional hotel and everything about it oozes five star. It should be on every traveller's itinerary to spend at least a couple of days at this hotel. We will be back.
Breakfast. 
"The room was very small and bathroom doors had problem. Not value for money. Had stayed here earlier, was given a better room. Not idle for old people and people on wheel chairs. "
Great spot great pool and nice bar and restaurant 
Not really value for the money you pay compared to other places. Concierge service not overly helpful
Balcony suite was wonderful & breakfasts excellent. Nanna wonderful breakfast manager
External paintwork was in a poor state especially front of building. Selection of drinks at happy hour in long bar was poor. If you are going to have a happy hour then make it a real happy hour otherwise I would have preferred to see the piping of the flag down at the main bar downstairs. Small front beach contained a lot of plastic litter that should be the responsibility of the pool attendant to clear every day. I picked up a lot but without a bin in sight all I could do was inappropriately give it to the breakfast bar attendant.
Wonderful old colonial charm to the hotel! Staff was friendly and accommodating and the food was delicious! They even surprised us with champagne in our room for our honeymoon!
The superior style rooms have very thin walls so you can hear everything in the next room.
The hotel staff were verry attentive. Great pool. The rooms very comfortable and the daily breakfast second to none. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.
"Stay at this hotel for a sense of grandeur and history. It feels a little like going back in time, in a good way. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite, which was about the size of a London flat, and very comfortable. Everything was polite and professional."
No complaints.
Excellent location. Spacious rooms. We were upgraded to junior suite. Had a seaview and view of pool deck. There is so much history and tradition at this hotel. The small museum is a must visit. There is also tours of the hotel on certain days. 
Nothing not to like. Staff at the Verandah restaurant were so helpful but we ate at pool restaurant one night and found the staff unhelpful. They need to up their game to match the other areas of the hotel.
"Great room with a view, we were upgraded and also had a cake waiting in our room as it was my birthday. This was a very kind touch which was much appreciated.good location to have a drink and watch the sunset as well.Beautifully preserved features in the hotel, classic compared to many of the more bland modern hotels nearby."
"There was an event taking place on the chequerboard/area in front of the bar/restaurant and by the beach the night we stayed. We were not informed of this in advance or when we checked in and you could hear everything through the windows as our room overlooked it. That would have been ok as it finished reasonably early but the crew then started  to dismantle all of the props and metal structures that were in place for it. They woke us around 12.30 with the noise from doing this as they took no care to do this quietly. They continued doing this until after 2.30 am (I don’t know when it stopped!) as I eventually fell asleep then (with ear plugs on!). I didn’t ring down as I kept thinking that surely the hotel staff would see and hear what was going on. Also, they obviously wanted them to dismantle it that night rather than next morning so I don’t think calling down would have made any difference as I doubt it would have been stopped just for us. It seems such an odd thing to do at that time of night in the first instance. If we had been informed in advance of this event, I would have asked for a different room.When we checked out, we weren’t asked how everything was but I did bring this up and the manager was called. They were very apologetic and offered an upgrade if we stayed again but couldn’t do that as we said we were leaving Colombo. They then gave us 2 bottles of water..It was a shame as it is a lovely hotel but due to being older, there is capacity for a lot of noise through the windows and under doors at night. I would perhaps return if I was in Colombo but not anywhere near the busier parts of the hotel and I do not think it is worth some of the rates that were quoted on booking.com (we got it last minute for c£100 which was ok). We stayed in Paradise Road Tintagel the 2 nights before and found it much more relaxing, calm and very professional staff."
"Nice colonial propertyRooms were very spacious and well maintained despite its age Lovely sunset view from the terrace and pool Complimentary minibar"
Nothing
The staff were most helpful and welcoming. The room was very well appointed and the views great. The breakfast sélection was good. 
The coffee was not good. 
"Beautiful colonial hotel; we stayed in a Junior Suite with an ocean view balcony, absolutely magnificent room. We ate in the 1864 restaurant and the meal was faultless. Thoroughly enjoyable 48 hour relax at the end of our holiday - we’ll be back one day. "
Faultless but a word of warning - we were able to book an airport taxi for £4K (local currency) less than the hotel service offered - look locally!
"Beautiful building with fabulous salt water swimming pool and views out to sea.Lovely room with view over the Green. Good breakfast."
I was asked on way out if I was checking out because I did not come from reception desk. It was not a pleasant ending
Location was good.
The staff were not very attentive. Very inconsistent with training as there seemed to be no standard. The staff did not wear their uniform with pride.  I choose the hotel based on its history and location. I expected the staff to be better. Hotel interior needs a good refurb. I would not recommend to others as there are many better close by.
"The range of restaurants and their beautiful settings. Loved the location on the waterfront. Magnificent pool. The staff were very helpful and attentive. Beautiful colonial building and peaceful atmosphere."
Nothing.
"Amazing old property refurbished right on the sea. Hotel has a great history and a museum inside.Great central location. You can spend hours in the coffeeshop looking at the sea!!!
Mine was a short stay so i cannot comment on the food but looked like a huge spread .Excellent staff. Very caring. I fell down outside the hotel and was hurt. Quick medication and manager himself came to see me and called few hours later to ask if i needed anything. Bellboy   smiled in greeting when he came to pick up my bags even   as early as  2.30 am  in the morning."
There was nothing not to like..
"We were upgraded, so possibly not the most objective review, but the hotel itself is just beautiful, with the colonial architecture preserved and accentuated. The staff we excellent and the food (we only had breakfast buffet) very good."
The pool is sea water. It's warm though.
The hotel has a great atmosphere - really takes you back in time. Also level of service is very high. Great romantic place for a couple
N/A - we had fantastic time
"The staff at the reception is very rude and non-professional. But I only had bad experience with one staff. Other staffs at the hotel is very helpful. The hotel is has easy access to supermarket, shopping center and beach. Jewelry store is worth to visit. The breakfast at the hotel is good."
"Customer service. The hotel is old,  needs renovation."
"the hotel is amazing and walking in its big rooms and corridors reacalls you all the past of the hotel and its prestige. The room was big, confortable and very clean. The mini frigo was included with a lot of local products that we enjoyed either for the taste and as well for promoting national products. The staff was really carefull and nice altought they had lot of work as the hotel was full of people. The swimming pool was very big and the sun beds very confortable. We did not used the restaurant as we thought it was a bit overpriced if you compare with other options in nearby first class hotels and in any case that night menu was with international food and we prefered a more local option. But still it was very good looking."
"Is a bit difficult to find something that was not as we expected. Of course the price is a bit high for being in Sri Lanka, but it is still cheap exspecially if you think back to your country where a luxury hotel would cost half of my salary per night. We also used the pick up service at the airport that  was kind and professional but I found out that many agencies provide it 40/45 % cheaper."
"This hotel is a true gem. A historic hotel with ample charm and character , all brought upto date for a modern stay. Although there are many luxury 5* hotels popping up near Galle Face I couldn’t imagine missing the opportunity to stay here."
The charm casts a spell that smooths over any cracks!
Gorgeous rooms. The pool by the ocean a lovely place to lounge on a hot day. Old world charm and a great central location. Treat yourself to a night here. 
Pricey but worth it. 
"Well located, comfortable,excellent staff,everything worked well from check in to check out,one of the best I have stayed in throughout the world"
Nothing 
"Visiting the museum within the hotel. The sense of history. The cocktails in the bar. The flag removal ceremony at sunset. The very comfortable bed
The upgrade to deluxe side sea view :) "
"No bath in bathroom 
The muesli "
"The Environment, The Location everything is top of the notch.
The staff! They were unbelievably helpful, polite & generous. Everything is beautiful & elegant. "
"They added extra 30% of tax on everything without mentioning it. Even on Booking.com.
After I guaranteed by credit card (Non-refundable) the hotel & Booking.com said the fare excluded 30% of extra tax.
Even the dinning menu or In room dining everything is charged with 30% extra without mentioning. This is frustrating. "
"The overall ambience, location of the property, staff courtesy , house keeping is of good quality.The hotel is a very old hotel , has good history and is very well kept. The staff is mix of young and senior employees who are very friendly and happy to assist any time."
There is nothing i can say i did not like.
"This hotel is an absolute gem, one of the best in Asia. The look is classy and has kept its old charm but modernised the experience. Amazing staff are accommodating and the view of the sea is fantastic."
Nothing!!
"Hotel very old and made of wood so there are a lot of insects. Breakfast is the same everyday (staying there for 5 days). Staff chatting very loudly in corridor, impolite when answering phone call, and purposely avoid opening door. There is no washroom door separating from bedroom so it's very cold when taking shower due to aircon from the other. Soundproof is very low (wall is not made by concrete - tested after knocking). In room dinning options is very limited. To make the matter worse, the food quality is very bad."
"a perfect hotel which takes you back in time  to the british colonial era.A beach facing hotel , old style building adds class.very helpful staff and comfortable stay,"
na
"The age, history and beauty of the place are clear. In its time and even today there is a certain opulence you don’t get with a modern hotel. The staff are all incredibly friendly and helpful. The room is tastefully appointed and the bathroom had a beautiful hot shower with plenty of space. The bar staff near the pool were exceptionally helpful and kind, also they make fantastic cocktails. Sitting ocean side in the evening while the waves crash against the ocean wall with the warm breeze is magic."
The room I was in had an ant infestation. I mentioned it to the staff who told me it was an old building. I think the language barrier may have been a problem but I had ants all through my bed. If I put food down for two minutes sure enough the ants would swarm the plate. This made me very uncomfortable the first night but I forgot about it the second and third. Due to the age of the building and wooden floors the wood creaks and groans. The large doors at the ends of the corridors bang loudly and I could hear people talking in rooms far down the corridor or coughing at night. These little things are nothing more than an annoyance but it does lend to the age and beauty of the building.
"Huge room, great bathroom & shower, and the breakfast/lounge/bar areas looking out onto the sea front are brilliant places to spend time any hour of the day.Particular favourite was bagpipes at the flag raising/lowering"
"Beautiful old hotel with a rich and interesting history which has bee very well refurbished.We loved looking out at the sea and it has a good pool area."
"The room was pokey ,too small with suitcases and only a place for 1 case. Our room was on the main Galle Face Road so rather noisy though it quietend down in the middle of the night.Please watch out for the local touts who pounced on us as soon as we left the hotel on foot claiming to be a member of staff and wanting to help us cross the road. We were exhausted and did not pick up on cues that we both felt we would have on a normal dayDo not use tuk tuks in Colombo just get the hotel to arrange a taxi.Maybe we just were unlucky but our day was expensive and unpleasant.....Happy to say we have met nothing but kindness since leaving Colombo!!"
The Galle Face is a hotel full of charm and old colonial style with period furnishings but up to date facilities. The staff were all so friendly and polite and we absolutely loved staying there and would love to stay again. Breakfast was probably the best one that we have ever had  - the buffet had everything that you could wish for! At sundown complimentary cocktails were served on the seafront with canapes and a 'Beating the Retreat' ceremony by the Sri Lankan pipes and drums - simply fantastic!
Nothing!
"The staff were lovely, particularly the reception staff. Friendly, helpful, warm. The setting is beautiful also, just if they could tidy up around the edges it would be even better again!"
"The hotel may be a heritage hotel, but that doesn't preclude good maintenance and regular updating of fittings! The food at the bar is also very bad, warmed up frozen food. Gym is embarrassingly small for this grade of hotel."
"Location, clean, good food, no pests, great laundry service"
The bathroom flooded every time the shower was used & everytime we got it dried it was never fully dry
"Beautiful, old fashion style hotel - like something out of a 1940's movie. Location makes it easy to move around Colombo. Can eat in the hotel at the restaurants close to the beach listening to the waves from the ocean crash into the sand/rocks."
"Room was tiny and lacked space for a business traveller (even with an upgrade). There was a fruit bowl and chocolates left in my room (nice gesture) but ants had attacked and this resulted in ants roaming around the room on the desk, in-and-out of my laptop. Condensation problems in this hotel means clothes hung in room do not dry, but rather seem to get more damp with moisture, even with air conditioning switched on. Wi-Fi was exceptionally poor in my room. Almost unusable so I just gave up which was frustrating as my stay was for business. Gym is nice but way too small and lacks modern day equipment e.g. only 2 treadmills meaning a wait time which is inconvenient."
"I always stay here in Columbo. I like the staff, the views of the Indian Ocean, the location and the furnishings, but most of all the beautiful building itself and the sense of colonial history. I also like the pool and pool area on the edge of the ocean and - sometimes- glorious sunsets."
Nothing that springs to mind.
"I like the atmosphere, location and the staff's of the sea breaz. 
Front desk staff's too are really good."
"There were lots of noise near the room, minor staff's were shouting and gossiping near the room. (Cleaning Staff's)
Management issued us a letter saying that certain things are complimentary and on discount, but restaurant staff's are not aware about it. 
Person who came to check the mini bar was really rude, he ask the reason in delay in opening our room door.
Linen were too old, look faded.
"
Such history!  The interiors are incredible.  Location is perfect.
"Im not a fan of Buffet style eating, otherwise this hotel is amazing.  There is another fancier restaurant though to dine at.  Despite that, I would still stay at this hotel again."
"Old world charm with modern elegance.  Staff were helpful, friendly and were more than happy to assist you in any way. Emanuel, the concierge, was passionate about the manner in which he approached his job. His assistance was invaluable."
"The Galle Face was terrific... Its position and history and old world charm. The rooms were massive, I'm sure we were upgraded to a suite - we had the best balcony (and I will miss the resident crow!)"
One badly booked meal (fish) on one occasion at the pool bar.
The breakfast was very good and the buffet dinner excellent.Not enough choice during lunch.The staff were extremely helpful to arrange all the needs
"The first room we were given as an upgrade  was not in good decorative order and had a big bathtub in the middle of the room, which means it is not an upgrade in the old wing which needs to be reburshed."
The colonial style building and central location 
Our 3 teenage kids arrived into Colombo at midnight. It was 2am before they arrived to the hotel. Although we had already checked them in there was no bedding or towels for the 3rd person. I think a bit more attention to detail is important 
Location
"Went with the family. We got overcharged by the hotel. Staff and managers are horrible and they try to trick you once u check in and offer a free upgrade but then u realise that it was not free. Food is really bad. Rooms wr full of insects and ants, but they changed our room. Carpets inside the room are too old and stinky. And all that was fr 300$ per day. Never again."
The Galle Face Hotel is a colonial heritage masterpiece filled with all manner of colonial charm and ambience.  The 30m salt water pool was wonderful as I like to swim 2kms every day.
The cost of the driver from airport to hotel was very expensive.  The people that assist with external excursions didn't appear to be all that keen or willing to make much of an effort to provide assistance.
"Lovely Colonial hotel, great setting overlooking the ocean, a number of nice bars/restaurants in the hotel and friendly staff. Room was spacious and clean."
"The room was very comfortable for our first night in Sri Lanka. The hotel is beautiful, colonial style, with lots of 'hidden' gems (we stumbled across a museum storing Prince Philip's first car!). Service was excellent both at check in/out and in the seafood restaurant. Food was amazing too, very fresh and reasonably priced. Pool was clean and pool staff friendly/helpful in bringing towels, mats and drinks. Highly recommend if you have a night or two in Colombo."
Nice outlook
"The crows that flew around the property and into the restaurant, staff could have made a better effort to reduce their interaction with guest experience."
The fudge on arrival! Big pool and a lovely choppy sea view.
"Front desk staff - ignored us when we first arrived and then didn’t feel the need to say we’d left sunglasses on the counter when we checked out. We were in a tuktuk before we realised and came back and the glasses were still sat there. There’s so many staff in the reception. Also the man managing the pool literally pulled sunbed mats from under people at the mere flicker of rain. They got wet when people swam so a little OTT."
I read a few reviews saying this place was a bit tired and shabby. That must have been before a makeover because it's stunning now. The spa is the best quality that you would find in London and the rooms are really beautiful. Great food and cocktails and not particularly expensive. The room is significantly more expensive than most places in Colombo but it's definitely worth it. You won't find this kind of old glamour anywhere else.
"We checked out a lot of Colonial Hotels during our Sri Lankan holiday and this one tops them all. Staff were so friendly and accommodating, my room had a lovely view of the sea, huge bath, the outdoor salt water pool was fabulous, and they even have bagpipes playing to take down the flag at dusk. Don’t miss the chance to stay, absolutely a holiday highlight!"
Service tax not included and not really clear until the bill comes. Otherwise no issues at all!
"The hotel is gorgeous, especially the newly renovated rooms. The second floor has amazing large balconies, great for evening drinks. The restaurants were also very good. All the staff were amazingly helpful and lovely, responding positively for all our requests. will be certainly staying there again on my next visit to Colombo."
"Room service can be a tiny bit slow sometimes. But if you're one a balcony enjoying the view, it doesn't matter much."
"As described, the atmosphere and the breath of history is really impressive. The staff, especially at reception really friendly, helpful and very polite, top 👍"
"I really cannot say, what I disliked. It is an amazing, huge hotel, where you can breathe history, kind of hotels, I usually like more, then these super modern hotels. Staff, especially at reception was extremely friendly and helpful, sure top class. But leaving the hotel, there was missing this wow effect, wanting to stay another night."
"Wished we had stayed longer to fully experience what the hotel had to offer. The building itself, and the staff were amazing. Bed SO comfy! Sadly we didn't get to have breakfast :("
That we weren't there long enough!
"Location is excelllent, rooms are clean and nice "
"Staff was impolite, room allocation was horrible, with two infants they made me change 3 rooms before the room that i had booked was alloted, happy hours manger was very rude and bad behaviour."
"This place is an absolute gem and completely worth the money - it will really make your stay in Colombo very special. From the beautiful rooms, variety of restaurants and gorgeous pool, this was an excellent hotel. I highly recommend it."
I had my wedding ceremony at the hotel and they went out of their way to make sure that the weather didn't dent our celebrations! excellent customer service and very friendly staff. The oldest/prestigious hotel in Sri Lanka gave the best service which is on par with the industry.
"If you like the movie Casablanca you will love the famous Galle Face hotel. The staff, service, and food are delightfully elegant in an old world way. The building and grounds are magnificent. We enjoyed the spa which is well run and clean. The food is one half English style and half Indian-Sri Lankan. The outdoor restaurant is sooo pleasant. The room was airy and spacious. Complimentary snacks and fantastic room service. Loved the experience."
We’re sorry we had to leave.
Beautiful colonial style hotel great location... We were there on a Buddhist holiday w/e with wonderful festivities and lights around the city but no alcohol served anywhere when we were dying for a G and T by The Indian Ocean at sunset .. Which is why you stay at Galle Face!
"The GFH was stunning in every aspect, the food, rooms, pool. There is such a grand old-world feeling to this hotel. We loved everything about our stay."
Staff were really friendly and helpful. We got a tour booked for Sigiriya and Dambulla and it was really nice organized.
"This hotel is not worth the money. It is really expensive for what you actually get. The room is not that big, it has just a tiny window facing some houses roofs. It was really humid, all the clothes in the bag got wet due to the humidity and the beds felt like they were wet as well. Tv quality on the room was really poor, double image, pixeled... the shower wasn’t great either. Really close to the wall which will make all the water get out of the bathtub while you shower. The room controls (lights) were like 30 year old. Overall experience wasn’t great. Considering the amount of money we paid, we’re not happy with the results."
"We only stayed overnight after flying in to Colombo.The hotel was well kept overall.The staff were friendly and attentive. The room was a good size as was the bathroom. We had a nice view of the bay.The breakfast was substantial."
The bathroom had a fair few cracks and could've been a bit cleaner.
View was divine .. room great service excellent .. we loved the buffet and Seaspray restaurant.. we will look forward to coming back soon and wish we could have stayed longer
"Beautiful traditionsl historic hotel, so much Old Ceylon charm! Great bed pillows. Nice staff.loved the museum and the Travellers bar."
"The restaurants charge a fortune..we went to the seafood restaurant expecting top seafood, we had a cold shared seafood dish -  but it was tasteless and small quantity, service was poor had to ask several times for the waiter to come over...we were really disapointed.  Bed was also uncomfortable but pillows were great."
I was only like the location
"In the name of Gall Face I thought its one of the best place to stay in Sri Lanka, Finally I have realized that I have made the wrong choice. I would not recommend to anyone this hotel anymore and I will never go there again.I was there with my family for a short stay and I was totally disappointed about the food and the services that we were received, I paid about AUD500 Per day, but its not worth what I paid.Specially, there's nothing to eat in the buffet, most of them are empty, also, labels are  incorrect,  there are many issues which I could not wright here. And it's not good for the star hotel like this. hence its effect to the reputation of the hotel and to the Country.Thanks"
"The view was great to enjoy your breakfast on the veranda. The food and service at breakfast was wonderful. Meal in the fine dining restaurant was just perfect. Staff very friendly, informative and helpful."
"Difficult to get to room on 4 floor, very confusing. Very dark in  bathroom to get ready, no natural light. Room on road side so a little noisy. Air con only effective if on high all night.Hit and miss depending on the room you get i think!"
"Beautiful rooms with view on the sea 
Incredible location and amazing atmosphere 
Got upgraded to an amazing suite "
"Slow wifi 
Bad reception on the tv "
"Excellent breakfast, gorgeous views from the terrace. The pool was lovely. Generally the hotel is an oasis of tranquillity to escape noisy Colombo!"
Room had a slight drain smell.
Amazing location...couldn’t ask for anything better. 
Food variety could be improved. If they don’t have enough occupancy they don’t serve buffet breakfast or dinner.
This hotel has the best position in Colombo with a wonderful seawater pool right on the beach.  It has been sympathetically renovated with very comfortable rooms but still retains a nostalgic grandeur.
"This was our second stay at Galle Face Hotel. It's full of old-world charm, the service is excellent, and the food at 1864 is delicious. The spa is far better than it was two years ago. Overall, a great experience. We'll definitely stay here again."
"The breakfast could've been better. While some items were very good, others were rather bad. It's a bit of a hit and miss."
Staff were fantastic helpful and friendly. The breakfast and themed dinner buffet was excellent. The spa was amazing. I would recommend this hotel to others.
"Location and people Good , Breakfast Excellent and Chef was so co operative to support for Pure Veg Food and Guided us."
"Carpet very dirty , In Room too much ants .Though they know I am handicapped having walking problem they provided room is south block which far away from lobby and breakfast area"
The location was great and the building beautiful
"I was told that I would have a sea view but was put in the back by the linen storage cupboard!  Food in the bar was truely terrible - samosas that were cold and rubbery and also a club sandwich made with stale dry bread.   Overall a disappointment. Some style but very little substance."
"Location is great. Hotel is iconic and well preserved.Nice museum."
"There is no beach.Very small pool.Crowd invade the dinning area near the pool once food is served. N Ed’s to be addressed by management."
"Always a great place to stay in Colombo had a sea view room , breakfast was very good and as ALWYS the staff super helpful and friendly"
Towels in room a little worn and no complimentary water at the pool as in previous visits
"This is a beautiful historic hotel that has some amazing features to it. We loved the museum and the restaurant, we also sat out at the seaside bar and had a late coffee, it was a wonderful location. "
"Amazing location, very nice hotel. The buffet was one of the best I’ve tried with an excellent price and variety. The hotel is well maintained. The staff are friendly, I had a problem with the WiFi and they took care of it in a few mins. Excellent place to stay. I asked them for a cake for a celebration and they had it in the room right on time. I definitely recommend it. "
"We returned to this hotel to recapture a treasured memory after having our first meal in Colombo there when we honeymooned in Sri Lanka 6 years ago.They kindly gave us a room with a sea view.  It is a grand old hotel and the buffets are to die for. We had breakfast both days. The swimming pool overlooking the ocean is great. The staff were very friendly and accommodating."
"The rooms are in need of a bit of TLC. Although we love the authentic vintage of this hotel, a little bit of sprucing up in the bedroom and bathroom would make a world of difference. It is expensive to stay here and the cost of food and drinks matches this.  We knew that when we booked so that’s ok."
"The food in the restaurant was excellent and there was a good choice. The saltwater pool was large and deep, and warm!"
"The room was not in good condition - it felt tired and some maintenance was needed on the towel rack in the bathroom. The smell from the drains was very noticeable.  More significantly, and what really ruins the hotel, is that the staff attitude to guests was poor, with an air of self-importance which shouldn’t be present in such an expensive establishment.  The staff on the pool bar were lax and more interested in chatting with each other than serving. Very disappointing."
"Loved the property - beds were very comfortable, rooms were clean, staff very friendly and knowledgeable, enjoyed the 'club' room, salt water pool was nice. Would definitely recommend this to others - especially if they like historical things - restoration is beautiful."
Have no complaints.
Beautiful building and classic location. The wedding receptions are pageants.
"Synthetic - or, at least, blends - towels in the bathroom - which did not absorb water - and synthetic serviettes in the restaurant. Resupply of the room was a bit erratic. Food was okay, but not great."
Great location and really nice staff and wonderful ambience!
Could have been more chairs in the room. Only one. Or other places to put clothes. Bad towels.
"Wow, from the moment you walk into Galle Face Hotel you know that you are in for a good stay. An incredible old building in immaculate condition with friendly staff and great facilities."
"Helpfulness if staff. Celebration day on 15/4 was lots of fun with drummers, dances & games. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Chef Brian was cheerful & happy to explain all about Sri Lankan foods."
Making a mistake - my partner & I both accidentally made a booking each. The hotel upgraded 🤗us one night at our request but no cancellation ☹️
"Owners did a great job of maintaining the history and heritage of the property, while also providing modern comfort. There are small niggles (minor fit and finish issues, leisurely response to some requests) - but would recommend to take it as part of the charm. The gentleman hired to scare off crows with a slingshot outside the breakfast place is a remarkable anachronism."
"Request to set up an extra bed took half an hour and a reminder before it got done. There were minor imperfections in the room (slightly askew hole covering the ceiling, rattling bathroom fittings)."
"To be honest: We read a lot about it and were a bit sceptical but the Galle Face hotel surpassed our expectations!
Beautiful wooden floors, breathing history in every corner, very friendly and helpful staff, located right by the Indian Ocean, amazing breakfast, clean and well air conditioned rooms, very nice and long saltwater outdoor pool!
Like we said in the title: A perfect place to stay your first few days when you arrive in Sri Lanka"
Only negative point is that from the hotel you have to look at the Harbour being build opposite the hotel ruining your view!
"Excellent staff; the breakfasts were lovely and the rooms extremely comfortable and well appointed. The pool was fantastic and loved the location at the far end of the Galle Face Green. Made for a pleasant stroll into the Fort area. I had trouble checking in for flights on my mobile and was able to use their business centre to do so and print my boarding passes. The common areas are also very beautiful, you can really feel the history in the hotel without it being run down. Room service was excellent in quality and delivery."
"My experience in the spa was horrible (that being said, my sisters was fantastic and they did offer me 15% off my service based on the feedback they asked for right after the treatment, even though I didn't ask for any compensation). I found the buffet dinners at the Verandah the two nights we went (Japanese and Indian) to be OK but overpriced for what they were. Unless you are a big eater, I would go with a la carte."
The staff were extremely helpful. I liked the free minibar despite no alcohol in it. I loved the building the history and the museum. It had some great pictures throughout the hotel. It was a great last hotel of our holiday. We were treated very well.
View of the docks and ufgly buildings that now surround it.
Location & ambience
"Financial discipline. I was charged double for my room. A pre authentication of $ 250 was excess charged to my credit card instead of cancellation of the pre authentication.This is unexpected for a booking through Booking.com. We will lose confidence on the site if this continues."
Local Sri Lankan food at Dinner and Breakfast was excellent.
"Unfortunately not the best place for a woman travelling alone. Before 8 am in the morning, a male staff member unlocked and entered my room while I was in the bathroom. After I spoke out, he quickly backtracked and I confronted him in the hallway outside to query his presence in my room. His excuse was to do my laundry, which had not been requested, and why would that require room entry anyway? Next, during breakfast in the Ladies Washroom downstairs of the bar area, a male staff member stood grinning in the doorway as I came out of a cubicle to follow me (dressed modestly in long sleeves and long skirt) to the stairs making suggestive remarks. Although the Hotel Manager expressed concern about the incidents, sadly I will not consider to stay again alone in this place."
"This is the only place to stay in Colombo. Directly on the beach in an iconic area. The hotel has had a magnificent make over. Old world charm overlain with everything that you would expect from a 5* hotel nowadays. Lovely wooden floors and large, well equipped spacious rooms. The hotel staff were lovely and very helpful. The food was excellent and the most amazing breakfast. The salt water swimming pool was a treat and watching the sunset in the grounds and the piper piping down the flag at the same time was a treat."
Nothing
"Lovely old hotel with lots of charm. I would stay here again for a day or two en route somewhere else in Sri Lanka, as this is (in my view) a transit hotel not a holiday location due to no beach. Ask for room 2044!"
Reception and check-in staff. Delayed our check-in by 30 mins and tried to put us in a room that was lower than the standard we had paid for. This started our stay with a bad feeling about the hotel. Staff are good but could be better.
The breakfast was the best I had in Sri Lanka. Nice big room.
Very expensive. For this price they should include an airport shuttle at least. Also the hotel taxi driver overcharged me for a very short journey. Avoid them and use the tuk tuks.
"This a great old colonial property, essentially modernized, with a convenient setting in the center of the city.  The facilities were beautiful and well-maintained.  We stayed in the premier balcony rooms and enjoyed a spectacular view, a comfortable room, and access to an open-bar happy hour."
"This is not a perfect 5 star top-class hotel; the staff can be a little erratic, and the rooms have some wildlife and history despite their refits.  If you expect 5+ star perfection, this may not not for you, but if you have a little patience and enjoy some quirk with your heritage, it's a wonderful place."
The breakfast buffet is fabulous and the attention to detail by the front office staff and concierge is wonderful.
"The service in the Traveller's Bar was chaotic. wrong drinks delivered, drinks missing.  Needs attention."
"Loved it. We got a good rate so perhaps not the best room so we didn’t have a balcony (which is hard with young kids) but hat was our mistake! Museum, library and pool all great facilities. Also absolutely loved the fine dining restaurant bar"
Location and hotel are amazing. Graceful colonial building in original style. Hotel is adjacent to Gale Green and walking distance to Dutch hospital shopping area. On site food is good and reasonably priced.
"Service is hit and miss. To give an example (could give more) ordering a cab at the reception was a painful undertaking where I was sent by reception, to concierge, to an empty taxi stand to a porter who sent me back to reception where I was asked to call myself. Typically upmarket hotels can’t arrange a taxi for their guest. Not here (unless you take the overpriced hotel taxi)."
"The hotel has been beautifully brought up to date keeping the gentle ambience and features of the old hotel, combined with the comforts of modern living. Everything you need and more. Staff were efficient and very friendly - nothing was too much trouble. "
The only thing wrong was that we didn’t stay long enough. 
"Fantastic historical hotel, renovated not too long ago. Beautiful building with very nice historical details. Great service and very good restaurant. The bar outside is amazing with sea view. Favorite hotel in Colombo"
Beautiful heritage building near the ocean
"Small room. Poor wifi which kept getting disconnected, mould in the bathroom edges, air conditioning died in the middle of the night. wake up call late by 30minutes!"
My wife and I were treated like royalty!  Every detail was properly taken care of with excellence.
"I see my settings on Booking.com must be wrong.  I am an American, but this review states that I an Sri Lankan!  Never mind who I am, the stay was exceptional."
The hotel is run with efficiency and professionalism geared towards the comfort of guests.  The rooms are spacious and well-serviced and the staff strike the right balance between attentiveness and respect for your personal space.
The menu at the restaurant would benefit from the inclusion of more sophisticated dishes in both Sri Lankan and European cuisine.
The staff were wonderful in particular Kumar who looked after us in the long room. The swimming pool was well run and staff were accommodating in trying to find you a space at busy times. The gym although small did the job and the personal trainer there was a gentlemen. House keeping staff were friendly and accommodating also. Overall I was very impressed and I would definitely stay here again.
I didn’t dislike anything
"Beautiful and recently refurbished hotel. Excellent location, food and good service. One of a kind really. "
"Arrogant and condescending front desk staff. Extremely unhelpful during check in and reluctant to give a warm welcome. When asked to extend stay they said this was only possible at a fee of 380 USD which is a shame as later that day we got notifications of booking.com offering rooms at 100 USD. This really gave a negative twist to our overall stay.
The fact you cannot pull up in a tuk tuk is ridiculous. This is Sri Lanka and not Monaco - please get a grip. 
With the ongoing real estate project on the west side of the hotel the view will soon be that of any major city and thus be ruined. I think the atmosphere the hotel boasts will be totally gone as Colombo is getting to ready to be the next Dubai."
The hotel has a wonderful history and is located very well.
"The windows on the side of our room were filthy. The blinds were pulled down on that side and the cleaners ignored the windows behind, like for years. The bath was also not clean and when you turned on the jets, loads of black gunk came out. The staff were generally quite snooty and were not overly keen to provide good service.In general the hotel is a little tired and very over priced."
"Staff was very friendly and prompt supporting (especially Mr.Manoj). I travel once a yr to Colombo for biz, this is the 1st time to Galle Face and for me it has the best compromise quality/price."
"The hotel has a rustic feel to it, it has character, and at the same time provides all the modern facilities. Right on the sea, views are great."
"service in the restaurant was not always efficient, waiting to be serviced"
"We always stay there. Everything works, the food id great, the position unrivalled, and you can't beat the retro-Imperial chic of the Real Thing. Also, the gym's been fixed with new kit."
Nothing
"Beachfront, colonial charm."
"Surly staff, the only hotel we stayed at where the welcome was indifferent. When the power failed 0630 as we were leaving, we dressed in the dark and were unable to use hairdryer, manager said it was my fault for not having reported it, despite it being quite inappropriate for a workman to be in our ( 2 females ) room as we were dressing and packing for an early airport departure. no apology. Poor service, no hand towels or dryers in the hotel loos."
"For our final stop in Sri Lanka we chose to stay in a nice room in a nice hotel and picked the Galle Face Hotel.  We had a junior suite with a private balcony and lovely spa bathtub.  It came with breakfast and free happy hour drinks (which we sadly couldn't take as much advantage of as we would have liked).  Not a cheap place to stay, but very luxurious and would have been nice to stay another night or two.  We were delighted to find the hotel had a library - and amused to discover the museum.  It is a charming colonial hotel and the most formal place we stayed at in Sri Lanka."
Many coastal places have seagulls - Galle Face Hotel has crows and they will steal the food off your plate if you're not careful!  They also went after my hair a couple of times.  One of the restaurants has someone employed to shoo them off with a laser pointer which was somewhat effective.  Occasionally the air conditioning was a little fierce.
"Was a lovely stay the staff were lovely particularly Shiraz on reception he was very very helpfulLooking forward to returning again soon. Bedroom was lovely, excellent shower and very comfy beds.  The breakfast choice was exceptional"
We liked everything
Location is by far the best among all other hotels in Colombo.
"Interior of the room is old could have been updated.  I am sure there are better rooms at higher prices.  However, there are far better and newer hotels with better services are available at better prices.  This hotel is betting on the past fame than the actual current state of the hotel."
Watching the sunset from the bar and the piper piping down the flag is very moving.  Hotel has teal style.  Great free mini barwell stocked.  Comfy bed very relaxing
"The Agatha Christie atmosphere, location, food, staff come from another world, unfortunately passed away..."
"Who cares ?...you don't want it to be perfect.."
"I stayed at GF twice. The first time I was lucky to be upgraded to a suite, where i was lulled to sleep to the sound of crashing waves.  The second time was in a beautiful room too.  I enjoyed leisurely buffet breakfasts......so many choices. thank you."
Another very enjoyable stay at the GF. Love the old world charm and the packed breakfast box kept us going on an early long railway trip. Very thoughtful.
Nothing. Staff used to be a bit offhand but no longer all were really helpful. A good couple of night's stay.
"Great location, property beautifully restored"
Rooms are small and service is extremely slow in the restaurant. My sorbet came to me in a slopping mess after having had to wait nearly half hour for it.
Great setting and heritage.
Our room had no view. So check before booking. The car service based in the hotel turned out to be by far the most expensive we used while in Sri Lanka.
"We stayed at the GF on the first night of our trip to Sri Lanka and loved it so much that we decided to stay on our last night as well. Perfect welcome from staff, who were kind enough to upgrade us so that we could be closer to the pool, a cuddly toy for our new baby, beautiful room with Jacuzzi bath, delicious dinner and breakfast. Can't recommend highly enough."
"I have never been so inspired by anywhere quite like the Galle Face Hotel.It’s rich in history, incredible art works, the hotel decor is so classic, yet warm and inviting. It uses a range of textures, fabrics, woods and colours. The people who make the Galle Face so inviting with their warm smiles.The day spa was exceptional.Highly recommend."
Old colonial building
"I was arriving early morning. To make sure that I do not encounter answer like: check in time is after 2 my room was paid from day before... well it was not ready! Of course I protested and made sure they read the reservation again. It took over an hour to clarify that. Honestly it should not happen. Then I was given far inferior room with dirty windows overlooking parking, for a short period. I moved to my room early afternoon. They should take off one night from my bill at least for that kind of service!!!! NO, they did not! So not such a great experience. I could stay in Shangrila just across where I have high status, I loved the look of the Galle Face..."
"Bathroom is good, great water pressure. Great food and dining. Beds great. It’s a lovely hotel."
We had to move a lot as we wanted and paid for 2 rooms which were not provided.. took a while to get the correct rooms.
"We had a spacious comfortable room. The restaurant on the verandah serves varied buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner. At sunset, the flag is lowered by an official accompanied by a bagpipe player in kilt. Good salt-water pool."
"We really loved our stay, in particular the decor and the ambience! Perfect location as well!! The breakfast was simply delicious! Very nice also the entrance and the first floor common areas!! Relaxing and fully of charme!"
"The room was quite small, but this was part of the charme and we do not see it as a negative point! We would definitely come back!"
"Large room and bathroom,very clean.No terras but the window can be opened. Staff very friendly. Beautiful spa, not cheap."
Swimming pool is with salt water.
"I knew this was a hotel with a reputation but I genuinely didn't expect to be as blown away by it as I was. Gorgeous, grand place. We tried the seafood restaurant and it was lovely. A holy day so no alcohol design at the bar but still a glorious place. If you have the ability walk up and down the stairs rather than use the lifts. Even the atrium areas are amazing!"
Nothing!
The communal rooms were great...fantastic old colonial feel. Our room had a great view.
The lighting was rather dim and the towels etc in the bathroom in short supply...
Overrated.  A very old hotel that does a poor job with soundproofing. Woke up when someone above my room started his morning prayers with a loud speaker.
The room is very comfortable and the complementary mini bar facility we enjoyed. Breakfast had a vast spread of food and delicious. Hotel staff is friendly and supportive.
The pool has no shallow end so a person who can't swim better can't enjoy the salt water pool. No view from the room.
"Great location and the service was friendly if slightly slow. My big comment was that we ate at 3 restaurants, the Verandah, the Sea Spray and 1864. The Verandah and Sea Spray were excellent, see below for the 1864."
"1864 was poor actually. Service was fine although it took an age for the wine to arrive as they had to get it from Sea Spray, but the food was far too western in a country with so much wonderful food. It was also empty on a Saturday night probably because of that."
Lovely room (in spite of being street-side (still not too noisy). Excellent fish restaurant (Sea Spray) looking over Indian Ocean) British Raj-type architecture  in wonderful setting.
"Staff (especially at buffet restaurant in evening) slow and lacked a welcoming smile (otherwise the key feature of Sri Lankan hospitality). Had problems and delays with correct billing for what we ate (nobody explained the computer was down!) ...not the best experience in our jetlagged state, so sadly we were left feeling the ""raj experience"" was a bit wanting."
"The room (2044) was big and comfortable. It included breakfast and evening drinks + canapés in the Long Room; very quiet with personal service. Food was excellent. The hotel itself is a classic example of British colonial architecture, a welcome change from the usual 5-star places."
Pool a bit small; limited space which could get crowded.
"A lovely old colonial building, directly on the ocean.We loved sitting in the garden, watching the sunset.Food was excellent and very tasty, the SPA area a bit too coldbut worth a visit. Go and see the little museum."
"A horrible construction zone is spoiling the view. Investors are building an island  right infront of Galle Face, call it Harbour city, with skyscrapers, Dubai style for many people. It is very very sad and will destroy the charme of the whole area."
"Really excellent service, fantastic breakfast!"
"Not the hotel’s fault...I feel sad  that there is a huge construction project underway, north of Galle Face Green. It doesn’t spoil the sunset view and some people who love building things will be fascinated, but it is constrast with this lovely hotel!"
"The hotel is very classic - colonial style but the rooms are well furnished and modern. We received a free upgrade to a suite, which was fantastic. The breakfast buffet has a nice spread of Western and local fare."
Milk Toffee on Arrival was a very nice touch.  The in house museum and library gave a great sense of history of the hotel along with the painting and photographs of the hotel in its past glory.  The Breakfast buffet was amazing.  The Lo'ocitane spa was fabulous!  In particular the  grounds facing west are a great spot for a drink whilst watching the sun go down.
"On check in we were told our room would be affected by noise.  when we requested to be relocated they were quite reluctant to do so, but in the end accommodated our request.  A very minor blemish on what was a great stay."
Colonial style. Location - listening to the waves break enjoying a drink/dinner. Excellent level of service. Sea Spray restaurant - great venue and great food.
Hotel can feel a bit tired - but it is part of its colonial charm and heritage.
"The room was perfect, with an amazing view to the sea and sunset, a very comfortable bed, and a lovely bathroom. The swimming pool is beautiful - cool salt water."
"It was wonderful to live in a museum for 2 days. It looks amazing in the lobby, restaurants, library,  and the museum."
"Unfortunately our room (4006) was a disappointment, the light was very unpleasant, the bathroom needs an urgent renovation (smells like mold), and the towels are grey instead of white."
It's not like a modern 5 star but it is well compensated by its caracter. Good breakfast but average coffe. High tea was excellent.
Not enough sun chairs at the pool. Only one hanger for bath towels is a bit annoying.
Fabulous and personalized attention. The hotel has a lovely view of the Indian Ocean with really nice sunsers. In the restaurant  they serve a buffet with different types of food every day. Always delicious.
I liked everything.
"Great location with stunning views, and nice food. "
"2 small things: Limited activities - which suited us, to be fair - and there were a lot of staff just sort of loitering around, which was mildly off-putting. 
"
Beautiful colonial building with wonderful sea views. Staff very friendly and the 1864 hotel restaurant was fantastic - best steak we've had in months.
The service could be very slow at times and the little touches you expect from a five star hotel were missing.
"This is simply a great hotel. It is old - 1860s -  but beautifully renovated. It is right on the ocean front and a 15-20 walk to the Fort area of Colombo. The seafood restaurant is superb. Great service, large comfortable and clean rooms, excellent public area inside and outside. Why stay in other hotels that cost as much or more when you get such character at the Galle Face."
Nothing.
The atmosphere is lovely and it was a pleasure to stay in such a historic building.
"I had a couple of water problems in my bathroom which were rectified; the front desk staff were a) slow checking me in b) weren't great at recommending how to get to places, so do your own research. c) I stayed in one of their basic rooms which was frankly average so upgrade yourself I'm sure there are nicer rooms"
Our bed was comfy and we had an excellent dinner in the Sea Spray restaurant.
It took over an hour for us to be checked in and there was no explanation from the staff about how to use the bedroom control centre. the WIFI was not very fast.
An excellent start to our holiday and a nice gentle introduction to Sri Lanka the staff were helpful and friendly.
A room with a view our room faced out onto the noisy street and road below.
"Galle Face Hotel is an institution in Colombo, for its heritage, service and location. I remember in from when I first stayed there 40 years ago. It has now been restored and the history and service maintained. Highly recommended!"
You pay for the experience. The price is prohibitive for some.
I had read about the Galle Face Hotel in a fictional book about the 1920's and have wanted to go there for a while.  Entrance lobby very welcoming and grand.  The staff were both friendly and very efficient.  Still had that air of colonial grandness even though has recently been renovated.
It is a real shame that such a beautiful and iconic hotel is soon to be surrounded by ugly tower blocks being built and the view to the West of the hotel and swimming pool is right in the line of huge building works being carried out for the new port.  Very soon Colombo will look like all the other big skyscraper cities in the world losing the charm.  The only thing I think could have helped is double glazing on the windows as you can hear the traffic as still single glazed.
Location. Good value for money.
"Hidden costs. False advertising from Booking.comHidden charges. VAT, Breakfasts, etc.Inflexible in room requests. Guests had to share beds or have fold up beds.In practical room check in & check out"
"Phenomenal view, amazing breakfast buffet, multiple bars and restaurants to choose from and an amazing pool. The building is 150 years old and has a long history of visiting writers, poets, politicians and other figures. The evening I arrived the Prime Minister of Singapore was dining in the higher-end restaurant - quite impressive! The property, pool, view, staff - everything exceeded my expectations. I was travelling alone on a stop before heading south and found the property very welcoming for a single traveler. I stayed in the ""old wing"" with a view of the courtyard and ocean and have to say of the 65+ countries I have traveled to this property makes the top ten!"
"The tub in the bathroom (in the old wing) wouldn't drain very well so there was standing water while showering. The room itself is old but that is part of its charm. Also, there is not much to do in Colombo but that is not the fault of the hotel."
Almond croissant excellent and very wide choice
Very small  point but would be good to allow Tuk Tuk to drop guests at reception rather than outside on the roadside
"Good old colonial style. Lots of famous people stayed here in the past. You feel like in Ritz or Claridges, but in the middle of dirty Colombo.Nice little beach, beautiful bars and restaurants.Food at dinner and breakfast was good. Taxi to airport 3100 rupee (45 min on the high way)WiFi is good( usually not in the other hotels)"
Check in and check out could be quicker.
"Hotel helped us with a very early Check-In and Upgrade and in general staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was great - nothing missing and great view. We enjoyed the pool - wonderful view and good water. Beautiful setting, wonderful hotel and very good pricing."
Being right at the seaside is so beautiful. Breakfast is fantastic. Being in this hotel with its history is a great experience.
"We had a room without a view (onto a adjacent building) which considering the price was a bit disappointing. Not very soundproof, probably given the age of the building. We could hear everything on the TV of the room next door and all conversations in the hallway."
"Old Colonial style of the hotel. Well maintained generally however sometimes lacked attention to detail.Good location for sightseeing.Staff were very polite and helpful but sometimes service was slow."
location is excellent
"housekeeping was very disappointing for a hotel this pricey. rooms were often not cleaned well enough. property , especially rooms not well maintained and not upto modern standards of comfort and service. Swimming pool was a disappointments - the shallow end was 1.5 metres, which meant people who are not serious swimmers cannot get into the pool at all."
This is a beautiful old colonial style hotel with a lovely pool and restaurant.
"We were given a different room to the one we booked which we agreed to as we were told it had a gorgeous view. The view was very mediocre and the room was tiny. It was obviously one half of a family room as there was a door connecting the room to another but there was a small table put in front of it. The poor guest in the adjacent room was violently ill all day, night and morning and we heard every bit of it. When we raised this at reception they just shrugged their shoulders....not good enough really for a hotel of this standard."
Still maintains colonial style.great seawater swimming pool with sea breeze to keep you comfortable in the heat. Reception staff really helpful
Nothing not to like!
"Was really looking forward to staying here again - I had fond memories of my stay several years ago. However on checking in I was told that the room (with double bed) I had booked over a month ago was not available. I was offered an ""upgrade"" - from Superior Queen to.... Superior Queen. That's some upgrade.Only after an argument with a second check-in member of staff was the mistake acknowledged, and I was offered a change of room for the following day.I feel I shouldn't have to argue with staff merely to have my original booking honoured. Very disappointing and a sour end to my holidays in Sri Lanka. I will not be using the Galle Face Hotel again."
"We had another very enjoyable stay at the hotel.First class service with very friendly staff who make you very welcome.Comfortable room ,good facilities and great location on sea front.Highly recommend."
Nothing
This is the fourth time I've stayed at Galle Face Hotel and I love it every time - a central location for the city right on the ocean.  Beautiful pool and restaurant areas and the careful room renovations still keep the hotel as special and characterful as before.
"Beautiful old building, felt like going back in time. Never did guided tour but would have been interested considering the people that had stayed here over the years. Raising and lowering of flag accompanied by bagpipes. Food good quality. "
"Beautiful luxurious historic colonial hotel, the restaurant food and drinks are expensive but service and food were of high quality.  We really enjoyed our stay here and loved having drinks on the terrace to watch the sunset.  Swimming pool area was great to relax and just outside the hotel door is the hustle and bustle of Colombo, however  as soon as you step inside it is is an oasis of calm.  Coffee was the best we had in Sri Lanka. Check out the hotel museum near the library room and see the famous people that stayed including a well known Cuban revolutionary!"
Nothing.
"Gorgeous heritage hotel in a grand colonial-style building. The verandah is an amazing spot to watch the sunset with a cocktail in hand. Rooms are spacious and the beds are very comfy, especially by Sri Lanka standards. Staff are lovely and friendly."
"The bathroom in our room was a little tired looking, but otherwise clean."
"This is the hotel to stay in when visiting Colombo. The staff were so helpful and lovely. The hotel is gorgeous and all the facilities are maintained to a very high standard. The pool and views are beautiful, food delicious and the hotel is very grand. A real luxury and brilliant first two nights in Sri Lanka. Definetly walk along Galle Face Green and head to the Ministry of Crab in a tuk tuk for dinner.... book first though."
Nothing
Beautiful old hotel. Lovely outdoor gardens. Book a suite room for complimentary access to the Long Room (free breakfast buffet and evening drinks). Staff were lovely and attentive. 
"Breakfast was good ,  Location on Galle face is excellent."
"First room offered very noisy, second room was found to be infested by sugar ants. Management tried to resolve all issues but in a short 2 night stay it's hard to keep moving rooms. I compare this hotel to Mount Lavinia hotel , sorry Guys you come second"
"Am a return guest so always good to go back and kindly upgraded my room, wouldn't stay anywhere else in Colombo . Excellent cocktails"
"Buffet style supper not as good as last time, but alone it's easier than sitting in one of the restaurants by oneself ."
"The hotel is in an excellent location next to the sea, with a pleasant outside bar area and pool, and very comfortable rooms. Staff were helpful."
The hotel was more expensive than we expected as we had not realised 30% tax was not included in the prices cited on the booking.com website.
The buffet breakfast was amazing and the views from the veranda just delightful for a great start to the day. The friendly staff and and beautiful building make this a place you should not miss staying in whilst in Sri Lanka.
Beautiful hotel
Wild new years party that took over the hotel. They provided no advanced notice. Party was extremely loud and went past 6am in the morning. We were not advised of the party ahead of time. Party goers snuck on to our balcony in the middle of the night causing mayhem. The hotel staff were surly and not helpful.
"We were in a relatively small room with 2 twin beds, but with a side view of the ocean, which we could still hear, and a very comfortable and cozy feeling overall.  Staff were very professional and accommodating; prices a little higher than other hotels we stayed at in Colombo, but not drastically so, and the beauty of the hotel overall easily made up for these small concerns.  Some of the other rooms we saw, going for a higher price, were spectacular, if you like a more colonial look.  Breakfast buffet was exceptionally good."
"Our room was a little small and, although the mini bar was free (a nice touch), there was no beer or wine or even chocolate in it as we expected from other hotels."
"We were welcomed and our bags taken care of, everyone spoke good english and it was the best customer service we had in all of Sri Lanka."
Pool bar staff could be a little quicker
"The place had character!Our room was very comfortable and so well appointed. All staff were very polite and helpful.Breakfast was plenteous and delicious.Dinner at the sea food restaurant was extremely good and our waiter so helpful."
Very little!
"I did not like the checkin cuz we arrived from an overseas trip at 7am and they let us in the lobby for 5 hours and did not offer us breakfast . After charging me 800 USD and after the long wait they tell us one room is ready and the room was not what I reserved.. and The charged me more money on my card 325 USD with out my authorization from me and that was done when I was standing in front of them I was shocked that I got msg from my bank I told them why when the manger check with fin dep he said sorry this will be reimbursed to my card and they did the same day cuz I was thereThe shocking thing after two days of checking out they changed me 708.14 USD and I called and they say it's holidays and they will back in my card I wish I was in Colombo so I can face them like the 325 dollars that they return right awayPlz booking.com , note this and help me ..P.s.I wish that I payed cash at this Hotel"
"Taking money with out my authorization, first time it happen to me in a 5 star hotel !!!!"
"The Galle Face Hotel is a beautiful piece of history. Set right on the beach, it offers lovely sunset viewing from the terrace restaurant or bar. The decor is a nice mix of modern and old; and the rooms are well appointed with comfy beds & pillows. Get a good spot on the porch/terrace, a nice cocktail & watch the sun go down while the piper plays & the flag is lowered. Very special."
Nothing
Liked the food and afternoon tea. And the historic touch. The pool is large.
Limited numbers of chairs by the pool. Surrounding area boring. No possibility to bath in the ocean depending on heavy Waves.
"An incredible hotel. If you want one night of luxury during your trip to Sri Lanka, stay here. Service is impeccable and the view from the pool can be stared at all day."
Nothing.
Galle Face hotel is an awesome place to stay in Colombo. It’s a beautiful hotel with an old colonial feel. The staff were lovely and the room was very comfortable.
"Lovely food - breakfast was just fabulous as was the evening mealLovely pool area and wonderful historyLovely old hotel with old world class"
Changing facilities near pool a bit basic
"Bit of a treat for us in a suite with balcony overlooking pool. We often stay in smaller places so when we do spend 5-10 times our usual nightly amount have certain hopes and expectations!!..... that the Galle Face achieved and exceeded! Great staff, excellent food,  beautiful old building, great location, nice little treats (like minibar goodies) , good pool, excellent room, complimentary fruit etc etc. My test is always ... .. would we spend this amount and stay again? 100% we would! Thanks!"
"The hotel itself was very nice. Great accommodations, amazing pool, great restaurants (more than 1 option which is great!)."
"Our room was not great. For what we paid, we got a room not overlooking anything that was much smaller than the images I saw when booking..."
"Lovely old hotel, great swimming pool and loved the sound of the waves crashing at night. Decent buffet breakfast and very good location to walk to other restaurants in the evening. Liked the pool bar especially at sunset"
The service could have been a bit better. Reception staff were good but the staff at breakfast were very slow!
We had a triple room for me and 2 teenagers. It was perfect with a seperate room with sofa bed and another TV and wel stocked barcfu of treats. The complimentary Long bar on the second floor for breakfast and happy hour was stunning.  The pool is nicely positioned looking over the each.
Not enough sun beds by the pool. Very noisy late at night with party music from downstairs.
"The fantastic heritage buildingSea view and nice bar, breakfast in the coursivesLocation"
"Old and slow elevatorsQuietness of rooms is poor: hearing strong waves and train being in the aisle facing the railwaySpa was under renovation but once finished it will be great"
"Very colonial in both architecture, aesthetics and feel. Good beachfront location, with friendly & helpful staff. Great food and sea views from the various seating areas."
The hotel itself is stunning and watching the sunset by the pool is quite remarkable however it is spoiled by hostile staff.
Although the hotel itself is beautiful the staff are shamefully unprofessional and unpleasant to deal with. Staff in the Verandah restaurant  are especially hostile which makes for a terrible start to the day. I didn’t appreciate the constant staring by male staff as I spent time by the pool.  Email and social media communication is appalling. You are not made to feel welcome at the this hotel. It is truly disappointing as the building itself is really breath taking.
"The buffet breakfast was comprehensive and tasty. The staff were very friendly and professional. Beautiful communal areas, this is a grand lady of a hotel."
"The gym was closed during my admittedly brief stay, and with the huge selection available at breakfast and the one evening meal I attended, I could have done with working out."
Good breakfast. Great pool. Lovely Colonial charm to this hotel.
Check in very lengthy process. We asked for connecting rooms and they couldn't accommodate us even though we were all one family so ended up on different floors. One room was much better than the other (view of the sea as opposed to the view of a brick wall) even though the prices were exactly the same. The breakfast is very nice. Good pool right on the beach. The staff were friendly.
"The location of the hotel being right at the waters edge wasamazing. Our room was sea facing and the sound of the waveswas therapy for a restful nights sleep."
"When we reached the hotel after a long drive fromNuwara Eliya , the welcome and check in was disappointing.Definitely not in keeping with the other 5 star hotels we use.The staff especially at the front desk were very impersonal.Unlike other 5 star hotels they were not very familiar with theirguests."
The Hotel is a superb example of colonial charm and decadence and is run with military precision. It is located in a prime part of Colombo and is located a short tuk tuk ride to places of interest. It was a treat to stay there and an experience we hope very much to repeat.
Nothing that could be improved upon by the hotel.
Location and outside look of hotel
"Very basic and old rooms.Price of booking was not respected. I was charged 40 USD on top of price of reservation without explanation, unacceptable!"
"Buffet was excellent, great choice and variety. Staff were very good, attentive and friendly."
"The pool was quite deep, even the shallow end which was very small, not good for a non swimmer. The room was a little smaller than I expected but quite comfortable. Also the spa and gym were out of service due to renovations. I was a little disappointed as I had intended to use the spa and using out off site is not the same experience."
Nice view of sea
"Room was pokey with lots of glitches. The temperature of the shower couldn’t be controlled so far too hot — and, despite having asked for it to be repaired, nothing was done even by the second day."
Got a free upgrade to a junior suite as we were early & our original room was not yet made. Beds super comfy!
The location of the room was right above the hall which played extremely loud music till 1130 the 2 nights we were there. It is impossible to sleep in that room.
clean good location and choice of breakfast was very good
took longer to check in and did not offer any drinks while we were waiting for the check in process
I thought the staff and the actual accommodation was the best part of our stay.  We ate in the seafood restaurant which was lovely.  Also the hotel had a lovely fragrant smell and is situated on the ocean.  We would look out of our hotel room and take in the scenery.
"The coffee wasn't the best but that's just my personal opinion, my husband enjoyed his coffee!"
The colonial feel
"There was a loud band on the first night on the floor below : loud enough to feel the music thru the floorboardsBut they finished up before midnight so all was OK"
"Sumptous breakfast, fantastic restaurant Seaspray 10 m from the ocean with waves crushing in and good seafood😊"
Difficult to communicate with them via email 😔 No answer!
"- Very attentive staff
- There is a lovely seafood restaurant downstairs
- Great selection for breakfast
"
"- Room felt a bit outdated, although I think that’s the look they are going for
- We got a tour from one of the hotel staff and it ended in the jewellery shop where we felt pressure to buy something. 
"
The room was outstanding as we got a free upgrade. Couldn't have asked for much more.
The adjoining room as we had noisy neighbours. We called the reception but it persisted until we had to get up for our flight at 5am.
Spacious bed room facing Galle Green. Breakfast is very well laid and carries variety of items - to meet the local and foreign pallet.
The layout of room could be ergonomically worked upon. Ironing board could be placed in room and lighting system needs improvement.
The pool was the best thing about the hotel.
"The Spa was being renovated - didn't know this in advance.The staff were not as accommodating and helpful as you would expect at a hotel of this level.  The restaurant could do with some sort of air conditioning - pretty uncomfortable in the heat."
"Lovely history and ambiance and location, and very good staff (as we encountered all over Sri Lanka).  On my request, the hotel laid on some flowers and a cake for my wife's birthday which was well appreciated"
"Thought the room was a little small but then everywhere else on our travels we had extremely large rooms, so maybe we were spoilt a little.  I also thought that what we paid for our kind of balcony room was well over the top"
Breakfast was good with a wide variety.staff where very nice and helpful
"Room felt standard whilst you where paying for luxury. Bar was expensive and didn’t seem alot to do around the property, also there was a small beach but swimming was prohibited"
Still charming despite the recent renovations. Especially liked the Veranda Bar & Sea Spray restaurant with its excellent sea food.
"Having arrived from Delhi on a morning flight, I reached the Galle Face at about 11am & had to wait two hours before a room was available -- and I was extremely tired!"
"A seemless blend of old and new with all the charm and convenience that you would expect.Gin and tonic sundowners - excellent."
Beware the pork sausages at breakfast.
Lovely old hotel with original features. Spacious room with sea views.
The staff seemed largely indifferent (unlike other places in Sri Lanka). Room was spacious but bathroom in need of refurbishment (bath sealant was black and toilet flush problematic). Had agreed check out at 1pm but at 12.45 received call asking why we hadn't checked out. Wifi access ceased immediately on checkout so had to ask for extension whilst we waited for our driver (10 minutes extra was provided). Buffet meals were OK but expensive whilst fish restaurant prices based on price per 100g so no indication of final cost.
"Very friendly and  courteous staff. Room was fantastic, Beautiful and clean. The view from the room was breathtaking. Food was marvellous. Enjoyed the fruit basket. Wish I had more days booked."
"Colonial charm, excellent food, very helpful staff. The breakfast buffet was wonderful with extensive local and western options. We had a huge room with a few of the stormy ocean. Excellent value compared to other places we stayed. "
"Looking a bit run down, patchy paint, broken gutters"
It is a beautiful hotel to stay in. It was a treat to ourselves at the end of our holiday after staying in guest houses for the rest of the holiday. It has a bit more character than most posh hotels. We loved it. The food was excellent too.
There's really nothing not to like.
The bed was very comfortable and we were in a good position near the pool and spa. The staff are very friendly and helpful.
"The spa was closed and we were not informed. The checkerboard terrace was not available because of weddings. The bridal preparation room was directly opposite ours so there was a lot of disturbacnce, especially at night after 11:00pm from the wedding party."
Grand hotel with a rich history. Lovely sea views. Excellent breakfast at The Verandah. Sea water swimming pool is quite unique. 
"Staff, though friendly and well mannered, were often slow to respond to basic requests. Gym and Spa were closed for renovation during our stay. "
This hotel has a very special and unique ambience---I would rate it amongst the top three hotels I have stayed at the past 10 years (and I have stayed at more than a 100) The old-world feel combined with the beauty of the surroundings make for a super vacation. The staff (all the staff) went out of their way to be friendly and helpful; day and night. The different restaurants offered a splendid variation of dining options at reasonable prices
I liked everything
"Great historic hotel. Room was large with a large modern bathroom.Pool area has great views right on the beach front. Breakfast restaurant had a good variety of quality food in a nice location.Hotel is walking distance to the Old Dutch Hospital so good for tourists"
The location was beautiful. The hotel itself is beautiful and the full of history. The room was larger and clean and comfortable. The restaurant is very good.
"Nothing really. You can't swim at their beach because of safety considerations, but that's not a big deal."
Beeing just direkt by the sea!
The Hotel inside should have more colours! The corridors are too dark and smell  as they were built 3000 years ago.... Also the poolside and surrounding looks poor and not fresh. You have not even enough sombrellos for every guest.... needs definitely renovation work. And the small sunshelter above the windows shiuld be painted yellow!! The hotel would then look fresher and more interesting!!also needs definitely more trees outside!
The hotel is a grand old colonial building with great staff and a lovely terraces. The seafood restaurant was excellent and good value for money.
Parts of the hotel looked a little tired and our room was small and dark.
"The breakfast buffet was fabulous with a range of Sri Lankan curries, hoppers, and western options like croissants and eggs."
No hooks in the bathroom for hanging clothes.
It is an awful destination. The price of this hotel is never $195.
"Exuberant price, low quality, and untrustworthy booking.com website. Galle face hotel is an awful very expensive hotel."
"The location is great, right next to galle face green and it is on the beach. Although you can not swim at the beach, it was perfect for viewing sunsets."
The service by staff could be hit and miss. For the most part the service was great.
"We were made to feel welcome and comfortable throughout the entire day and night until our midnight flight, even though we had checked out in the morning. Also gave us a later checkout and assisted us with our phone issues."
Leaving the property to explore Colombo😮
Beautiful hotel. Loved being able to hear the sounds of the ocean from the room. Excellent fine dining restaurant on site. Room was very comfortable.
Front desk/concierge could have been more helpful with questions we had.
"The breakfast was wonderful. For us it was the welcome to lovely Sri Lanka , and the bed made us rest to recover from our trip ...really comfortable  "
Nothing 
"I loved that the building was this an old colonial building, with so much history. I especially loved that the pool was a sea water pool."
"I dealt with a young recruit for check-in &check out. And while he had the best intentions, he was quite inexperienced and it became an unduly delayed check out.Also, one of our rooms smelt fowl (some problem with the toilet). They were kind enough to change the room.The superior rooms were very small & tight to negotiate."
"Staff services excellent. I got  a room with sea view+harbour. Room service food very good. enjoyed the stay. will come again to stayBeds very good. laundry services excellent Bathroom was at a good standing  complementary bar fridge free of charge."
the room bar fridge leeching and the room phone not working. Staff helped to repair same.
Loved the location . Very close to Galle Face Walk and Colombo.
Our room was comfortable but old. We invited family for dinner and we were very disappointed with the buffet. The people in charge at the restaurant were not very friendly. It was clearly just a job to them . Disappointing
"This is a hotel that is a good 150 years old. It is right at the heart of Colombo.We loved the food and ambience of the restaurants, the only salt water pool by the sea and the fact that it was so connected. The Main Street and the Dutch hospital are nearby where we wanted to visit."
There was a wedding at the lower level which created some noise for a bit literally thumping on our floor.
"Breakfast was incredible!! One of the best we've had in Sri Lanka .. Sri Lankan curry was spot on. And for those not eating Sri Lankan food such a good spread of continental breakfast. Great quality and taste. The restaurants and bar are right by the sea .. incredible views. Absolutely beautiful property"
We got our rooms 2 hours after check in time
I have been staying at the galle face for over three decades. I love the atmosphere and for me it's always like home
While I understand that the hotel needed refurbishment it has lost a lot of its character. Sofas in the galle instead of Sri Lankan rathan chairs and chaise lounges and no information of the historical role of the hotel and the people who stayed there
"I loved the location and the room. The staff were polite but totally inefficient- had to ask them for service several times before they even responded and repeat the request several times after which they got it wrong.The High Tea was awful. There was too much bread in the finger sandwiches and not enough fillings. Too few savouries. Poor quality cakes. The service was appalling. I had to ask for tea for one of my guests several times - I had to repeat myself to 3 different waiters who all got it wrong though I speak fluent English and Sinhalese and repeated my very simple request many times in both languages. In Colombo there are many hotels including  4 and 5 star hotels and restaurants that do high tea and this was the worst high tea I have ever had in Sri Lanka. Tourists probably think this is the high tea in Sri  Lanka and they would be wrong!The hotel advertises airport transfers which should be free but they tried to charge me an exorbitant fee. I called a local taxi ( Kangaroo cabs 0112 285 285) and got  an air conditioned saloon car with a polite and efficient driver for Rs 2850/- for my flight at 3 am we left at 12:45 am and was at the airport by 1:15 and my driver got me a trolley and loaded my bags onto it too . Don't waste you money and take a hotel taxi which costs about $80 (Rs 12,345) Breakfast was bad too. A tip stay there for the ambience if you like but walk across ( a short distance) to Cinnamon Grand have their high tea and breakfasts and food."
Service and food both appalling
the junior suite was spacious with many complimentary services.
The bottom sheet on the bed wasn't made properly and kept coming untucked ... this is the only thing I can find wrong!!
"I’ve booked the hotel for 5 nights, when I booked it showed that it had a gym and spa, but when I got there the gym and the spa was closed for renovations, I told the hotel that I want to cancel my stay in the hotel, and the staff was so helpful and booking.com customer support helped me too, the hotel offered me an upgrade to suit, but i said no and they only charged me the night I stayed and refunded rest of the money, The hotel is beautiful, nice sea view, and stuff was so helpful."
They gym and spa was under renovation
Good breakfast buffet - worth the extra charge
Relatively pricy hotel for Sri Lankan standards and doesn't really live up to its 5 star promise: Neither the rooms not the service is as good as it should be.
"Food was good, staff by pool and in the restaurants were nice."
Reception staff left our luggage sitting out in a corner of reception where anyone could have taken them. They didn't ask for our tag when we took our luggage from there. When I complained reception staff laughed in my face and were very rude.
Great atmosphere. Delicious food at the fish restaurant (quite pricey though). Pleasant service. Spacious and comfortable room.
The Spa has been under renovation for a long time now so there is no spa or gym available. This does not appear to be considered in the room rates.

"Porters Service on Checkout. None one took any initiative to load our luggage into our car. We were getting late for our flight. Finally our nephew had to take the car keys from the doorman and he him selves went to the car park drove the car to the front entrance and started loading our luggage.Porters were standing and watched us. The Manager on duty came and told them to Hurry  up and load our luggage . Then two porters started moving. Hotel has a strong mold smell. Over spray of air freshers in the lobby and in corridors. We were upgraded to a junior suite. I would not call that a junior suite. It is large double room for us."
"Public areas and restaurants here were wonderful- historic, stylish and full of character. Staff could not do enough to make us comfortable. Breakfast was superlative, and all meals were excellent and reasonably priced for a hotel of this type. We stayed here twice. On our first visit our room was very disappointing- poorly maintained, and overlooking a noisy building site. When we checked out, I spoke to the manager and expressed my concern that upon our return in two weeks, we would not have a similar room. He was most responsive, and when we returned, we had a hugely upgraded room, enormous,  with sweeping views."
"Some rooms are very ordinary- old and badly maintained. If you are given one of these, ask for a room change."
"I liked very little about this hotel. Rooms are large, airy and quite comfortable."
"Ambiance nice and it's all spruced up and restored, however, management and staff attitudes leave much to be desired. Staff seem to be more interested in talking to each other or on their mobile phones than paying attention to guests and their needs. I stood for five minutes at the restaurant overlooking the sea in front of two staff members who continued to talk with each other rather than attend do me and show me to a table till I interrupted them. In the bar, there were staff members everywhere, however, the service was awful! I think they all need re-training. Doormen on the main entrance had the strange habit of holding the door open with a foot so guests could enter or exit while they talked on the phone. On my last night, there was a huge row in the room above me with things seemingly being thrown around and occupants shouting at each other. It woke me at 0400 and continued till 0600 when it suddenly stopped. Hotel management did not seem to be able to stop it."
Location is great and the restaurants serve excellent buffet lunch and dinner.
"The old wing was a bit dated (especially the toilet) despite the renovation. The second night we stayed at the new wing, which has better decoration (new room) but we were bombarded with loud music from the ballroom nearby. Loud music didn't stop until 10:45pm and we had an early flight. Very frustrating."
Staff absolutely lovely. Breakfast was delicious...so many things to choose from. Didn't need to eat again until late evening! Lovely to see this colonial building maintain its traditional look and feel. Amazing views.
"This is odd but the overpowering smell in the lobby made me dizzy! It's like lillys mixed with some exotic airfreshner and I couldn't stay in there too long, it gave me a headache! The walls are pretty thin unfortunately so I was disturbed in my sleep a couple of times. "
"We were five people, who requested 2 rooms next to each other. But that wasn't given. Then when we all spent some time together in one room, the manager remarked that they don't allow so many people in one room, which was odd. We had rude people staying next door, and the manager almost justified their behavior."
"Lovely old colonial hotel, great bar and restaurant overlooking the sea and nice pool. Very comfortable room and great bathroom. A good place to stay."
"Lovely period property, complete with museum about the hotel's fascinating history. Right on the beach and facing the Galle Face green, where kids fly kites and families walk along the sea. The newly renovated wing is definitely better as the older wing smells a little damp."
"I'd have liked more la carte options (and local food over international), as there seems to be a love of buffet dining."
"A grand old hotel which has retained it's old time feel. The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable. a great hotel breakfast on the terrace and swim in the generous pool overlooking the ocean, made it even better."
Room had no view
Everything in this hotel was according to what we expected. History reflected everywhere and the verandas were beautiful. The breakfast location was amazing whereas the hotel was very centrally located. The room facilities were very good and I will gladly stay here again.
Loved the history of the bus.ding and the renovation of it was beautiful. Pool was lovely and the food and service amazing.
Our room didn't have a great view but we weren't there all that long. Probably a bit overpriced.
"The whole place is steeped in history and has a luxurious colonial feel. Its a nice experience to sit and enjoy a location where so many famous characters have visited and although it is expensive for Sri Lanka it is good value compared to similar hotels in England, even if only for a night. We enjoyed the buffet and cocktails and felt it was a lovely closing evening to our holiday in Sri Lanka."
This hotel is fabulous from its setting to its history it has everything to make your stay a sweet memory. Staff are superb and the food excellent. Several restaurants within hotel to suit all budgets. Rooms great and spacious. Can't praise this hotel enough.
Great property with a lot of history attached to it. The staff was extremely polite and helpful. Central location being itself a tourist attraction. Even the sunset high teas were memorable 
"Everything. From the view to architecture, the hotel is awesome. Only problem was, we got old wing and not the renovated one even though, we paid similar price. But barring that, everything else was just perfect. "
Rooms in the old wing and not the renovated one. 
Colonial hotel in prime condition. Nice fish resteraunt.
Offered an an inferor room to that booked. Had to view 5 rooms to get an apropriate one. Needed to be persistent. It's expensive paid £675 for 2 nights with dinner.
"Was not worth at all for the paid amount, nothing was good to tell about the property. There was no proper n immediate response from staffs at reception."
"Nothing i liked there to share, there was no door for bathing place..... wooden flooring in room was uncomfortable..... not sufficient light   "
Excellent  spread of  food. Great view of  sunset in the evening. Staff who understand  what personalized service is all about.
Hoped  for a greater blend of modern tech with the grandeur of the past era.
"beautiful views from the room. room excellent excellent service from the new fish restaurant overlooking the beach"
surly service at the main patio dining room. unhelpful and infriendly manager
"Lovely beds, lovely staff. Really beautiful and historical hotel. Loved the food that was served around the pool."
Couldn't fault anything except for the small lift!
"Great staff that knows the true value of customer service special mention for reception and the restaurant first class service.  if you are going to Colombo, this is the best hotel to stay in. it just shows part of Colombo history."
"The old British style building is amazing. The service is extraordinary and the location couldn't be better. If you book a Suite, you have access to the executive lounge, where you can enjoy delicious snacks and an fantastic view."
"Design of the furniture, flooring, bathroom was nice, prestige factor"
"Windows were very dirty, the hotel staff expects the guests to tip generously all the time, slippery floorboards in the main restaurant (i fell down), there were total of 3 guests, they did not bring extra bath towels, bath robes and extra cups, loud maintenance work was being done next door, our room had a view to the sea but also the garbage area"
"Truly historic hotel, beautiful colonial building and fabulous sunset views from the bar. Breakfast the best we had in Sri Lanka and lovely salt water pool, even in the rain!"
The rooms we were given were small and with the wooden floors soundproofing was an issue. I appreciate it is a very old building but I think you pay for the name when you come here. Time again I'd probably go for a sunset drink but not stay.
I was charged double as they had my credit card in their system. And the staff refused to rwsolve the issue with booking.com. and  no reply from customer services of booking. Com
Roons stink
"Deluxe hotel, great location right on the waterfront and the Galle Face Green. Excellent buffet dinner."
Strong smell of sewage from somewhere nearby made evening poolside drinks unpleasant one night.
Absolutely everything ....it was a real treat to come back to The Galle Face. I recommended it to friends and the 4 of us spent 3 night there. BUT...........
"As 4 ""seniors"", we were grateful and delighted with the upgrade given to us when we arrived.  I was unable to book this hotel in 1985 and it was a dream to finally stay there after all these years.
All was superb. BUT.... On our last night, we went to bed at 9pm  as my partner was suffering from food poisoning.  But it was impossible to rest or sleep due to unbearable loud music which actually made the whole room and bed vibrate, it was so loud. The noise apparently was coming from a large function directly below our room. By around 10.45pm, I had had enough and went down to the reception in my dressing gown. The night manager came up and politely agreed the noise was unexceptionable. He said I was not the only room which had complained. He offered the choice of another room (what? change rooms with a sick man in tow?), move to the room's slightly quieter lounge area which has a sofa couch (Still not acceptable with the price we were paying), and a pot of green tea. The latter was accepted along with the promise that the music would stop at 11.30. Well, the noise certainly was reduced but absolutely not eliminated. So, around midnight, my partner, who had had no sleep to assist with his sickness, asked me to call reception and we complained yet again. By this time, we were so upset and angry...sleep was simply not possible for some hours.
What I want to ask is...
1. Why are you...a 5 star hotel, subjecting your guests to this unacceptable disturbance, when you must know that the noise which affects this and other rooms is unacceptable....under any circumstances.
2. Isn't your guests experience at your hotel of paramount importance?
3. Why do you not block these rooms from sale when you must know you will get dissatisfied guests and risk complaints.
 On checkout....Nothing was offered to me in compensation and I had to re-iterate the story plus exhibit  strong dissatisfaction before the duty front office manager eventually reduced our bill."
"Staff were very friendly and helpful, they could not do enough for you. Although service in the travellers bar was rather slow. Breakfast was very good with uninterrupted views of the sea. Our room was very comfortable although slightly on the small side for the price. The free mini bar was a good plus too"
The spa and gym facilities were closed.
"Comfortable beds, good shower. Complimentary minibar with soft drinks and snacks. Staff were helpful. A lovely hotel but some disappointing aspects marred the overall experience."
Gym and sauna were closed. The view from our room wasn't great. 'Superior room' isn't superior by any standards.
This is a beautifully restored colonial building that oozes history. The level of luxury for the price is above and beyond what I had expected. My room was also HUGE! The location is about as good as you can get; though the area is quite pricey.
"Absolutely stunning, a real treat of a hotel to spend the last night of our Sri Lanka holiday. Definitely worth checking in and spending most of the time there! Just had a superior room and it was gorgeous, lovely furnishings, FREE minibar, view of the pool/sea, welcome lemonade and fudge, the most elegant and courteous staff. The hotel has so much to offer you barely need to leave."
"Outside of windows was a bit foggy so was not really a clear view, but that didn't matter much - we were not there to spend the day in our room!"
We tried to change our booking to a tariff (booking.com) to include breakfast but it seemed all too hard. The hotel never responded to our request and on arrival they told us we should have contacted Booking.com but that is never easy either.
"From floorboard to furniture in the lobbies, the whole atmosphere breathes Campherwood, Teak and Ebony. One expects to find Agatha Christie or Lord Mountbatten sipping tea under the Verandah. Class and charm."
backpackers and batik pants just don't fit there but money has no smell it seems.
The hotel was beautiful old world charm.  The flag lowering in the evening was beautiful with the playing of the bagpipes.
"We would have liked a larger room, quite expensive for the size"
"Great breakfast buffet, excellent cocktails, good room."
"Staff couldn't find my reservation, which was kind of annoying. Strange inconsistencies. I stayed here twice on the same trip, First time, no welcome drink, but bottled water and fruit provided poolside. Second stay, there was a welcome drink, but no water or fruit poolside. For this price, it should be consistent. Food at the dinner buffet not as good as breakfast, and should be avoided."
"The historical charm, the seawater swimming pool and unique surroundings."
"Nothing, aside few behaviours amongst occupants forgetting manners (noise and outfit)."
"This was the second time we stayed at this hotel. After a first experience rather poor, now we had a much better room in the renovated wing with a great sea view."
Magnificent view of the ocean.  Bar staff seemed the happiest.
"Service at the breakfast restaurant was below standard.  Every staff seem harried.  The floors were grimy and looks like the balustrades and blinds have not been cleaned for ages.  Worse, a party was going on all night on Saturday and they stuck us in the wing that had the music the loudest.  Thank goodness we stayed only for one night for a connecting flight."
Excellent location with a nice variety of eating venues. Easy access to the Green and not far by transport to major sites of interest.
"Poor signs, easy to get lost and to find venues. Needs a better informed tourist desk and disappointed they charged us over double the taxi fare back to the airport."
The wow factor as you walk in the hotel.  The hotel has plenty of history and the facilities are excellent.  The staff are polite but a little care free for my liking.  Good value considering it one of Sri Lankas best hotels.
Lack of beach in front of the hotel. Staff could do note to provide premium service.  The swimming pool could be bigger considering the size of the hotel.  Lack of warm greeting and lack of warm send off.
"A beautifully restored colonial hotel in a great location.  The grounds, swimming pool, bars and restaurants are lovely with gorgeous views out to sea. A delicious buffet breakfast too."
"Large, clean bathroom, the pool and restaurants are very nice. We had one of the best meals of our time in Sri Lanka in the seafood restaurant. The hotel has a strange, antique quality to it which isn't exactly luxurious but has an old-world charm that's quite unique, especially in an area of Colombo that's changing so dramatically."
"We were initially ""upgraded"" to a suite which was dark and oddly laid out with chipped paint all over the balcony as it was next to the renovations. To be fair we were quickly moved to a smaller but far nicer room. The rooms are a little dated for a five star rating but it's still good value. Gym and spa currently closed for renovations."
"I have stayed in many nice hotels around the world but I have to say I believe this is the best I've ever stayed. Location is excellent on the coast. The quality of finish and decor of the hotel public areas, rooms and bathrooms is superb. Some of the art work, particularly the terracotta wall in reception made me very envious. However the biggest accolade must go to the staff. Every single staff member we met was polite, attentive, helpful and cheerful. I must congratulate everyone at the hotel and cannot recommend it highly enough"
"Expeccially the food was outstanding. After 3 Weeks travelling in Sri Lanka, the food was here for us 8 people the best. The mixture of all the ingredients was astonishing and inspiring. Our room - first floor was rather little but nice."
All of us did not really appreciate that waiters took our plates and glasses when we were eating. They seemed too quick in this. Transportation to the airport with the hotel van is very expensive!
"The hotel has a real sense of history and is very elegant and stylish.  The staff were all very helpful and attentive.  The breakfast buffet was magnificent, and the choice of food at the restaurants in house also excellent.  The saltwater pool is lovely and big. The history tour, museum and library also all very interesting.  Great location and view out to the ocean.  Perfect place to return to and relax after venturing out in to the hustle, bustle and heat of Colombo, particularly if you have just arrived in SL and need to acclimatise.  We were also interested to witness the wedding that took place during our stay and the daily traditional lowering of the flag at sunset heralded by a bagpiper in full regalia!"
The spa and gym were closed for renovations.  We were however given the option to use a gym in a nearby hotel.  Beds not that comfortable.
"The staff were very friendly, we were greeted a refreshing lime juice after a very long journey from the UK. The location is near to Colombo Fort train station."
Nothing
"Old school charming hotel, polite and good staff. Very good salt water pool."
"One room (#2021) was problematic due to extreme humidity accumulating, but we had it changed and did not pay for that night."
"Hotel has a ""traditional feel"" of luxury all through. WE only stayed for one night on the way through Colombo but I had to drag the wife and kids (all over 18) away as they were enjoying the rooms / feel / views so much. Would thoroughly recommend"
hit check in at a busy period but they handled it well
The service at Galle Face was exceptional and it is the most wonderful hotel to stay at. Gorgeous views from our room and the entire hotel. The pool and restaurant by the beach were divine. An absolute must to stay and very good value for money.
Nil
Lovely hotel at a very convenient location. The pool and views are breathtaking and perfect for a relaxing drink or two! The hotel amenities and service was excellent.
"The hidden 30% taxes that are applied on top of the room rate on booking.com. This was not the case at any of our other stays in Sri Lanka A triple room consisted of 2 beds where neither was able to fit 2 adults comfortably. Perhaps a queen and a single is more suitable for rooms expecting 3 guests. A concierge service for train tickets, short distance transport etc would have been helpful for a hotel of this class."
"A beautiful must in Colombo! It was a perfect way to start our holiday in Sri Lanka - we got to taste a little of the colonial history from the beginning and was ready to experience the amazing Sri Lankan culture further. Just a unique historic experience - and at the same time great luxury. Funny to see all the pictures in the bar of the famous people who have stayed at the hotel during its long life. The morning buffet was spetacular - and the passion daiquiry too :-)In the evening we walked a long the shore from the hotel to the old Dutch hospital where we had a great Sri Lankan meal (20 mins walk)"
"There was a historic tour around the hotel in the afternoon, which we missed since we saw the information about it too late. They should have informed about this when we arrived. We would have loved to experience this too. The pool area is not safe for small kids - as there is no fence or border from the sun-beds to the very dangerous rocks and high waves just underneath. Keep the kids close :-) The somewhat nasty and cheeky crows (that rules the Colombo area) are pretty annoying in the pool area - they will steal your food if you look away for just 20 seconds."
"We had a great experience at this hotel.  I cannot fault it in any way.  Very comfortable, great setting.  I would stay here again."
Their communication could be improved.
Luxurious hotel in a great location. The whole hotel smells amazing and it's very high quality. Seaspray restaurant was brilliant.
The gym was closed for refurbishment and though there was another in walking distance down the road this was inconvenient. The restaurants are not great value for money considering the general price to eat out in Sri Lanka. Also a large group of teenagers - some sort of sports tour - we're a bit rowdy and swearing around the pool during our stay.
"Good location, staff couldn't be nicer or more helpful. We left a kindle & they sent it by courier to our next hotel (150km away) at no extra cost. Now THAT Is good service!!"
"Not much, it was very good!"
The staff were very friendly & helpful
Original room was in the old fashioned end of the hotel & it was in need of some renovation but they upgraded us to a junior suite (for an extra £30/ night) which was an amazing room with beautiful sea views
"The perfect place to start your Sri Lankan adventure. The hotel was so old world and you could imagine the British royals staying there in the Past. Breakfast overlooking he ocean was lovely, staff were super helpful and the door man in his regal 50 years of service uniform was special. We felt so comfortable, safe and walked everywhere because it was smack bang in the Centre. Highly recommend, beautiful service. "
"What an amazing hotel!  We arrived late afternoon, and checked out the following morning to travel onwards to Kandy which really didn't give us enough time to appreciate this beautiful hotel!  Our room was wonderful; the separate lounge area with sofa bed for our son was perfect.  We had dinner at The Veranda - a wonderful buffet with a wide selection of courses and dishes.  Breakfast in the morning was also lovely with a wide choice.  Really wish we had more time to stay and fully explore this wonderful historic hotel."
"The night of our stay there was a wedding at the hotel -  a wonderful venue!  However, when we returned to our room following dinner, it sounded like the wedding party was taking place in our room, especially when the live band started.  We phoned the reception who told us the music finished at 11.30pm.  We asked if they had earplugs, which they didn't, but did offer to move us. This wasn't ideal at 10pm, but we moved to a suite in an older part of the hotel, away from the noise.  However, the room was cold, unwelcoming and did not have the bed required for our son.  Staff brought us blankets to make up a bed on the floor with the cushions from a sofa, which was far from ideal and we decided to move back to our original room and put up with the noise.  I'm not sure what the hotel can do regarding the noise when there is a wedding or an event - maybe at least let guests know, and provide earplugs!!"
"Nice building, well located.  Excellent service at the seafood restaurant."
"Surrounding areas are not so clean, but that has nothing to do with the hotel"
"The general feel of the hotel is of past glories and a beautiful colonial heritage.  The breakfast buffet on the terrace was heavenly. The rooms were beautifully presented and falling asleep listening to the roar of the ocean was something everyone should experience in their lifetime.The pool was lovely and deep and great for swimmers."
"There were one or two members of staff that were on the top of their game but, in general, we found the staff surly.  I suspect this is due to the hotel's incredible history and them being used to celebrity guests.  The house cleaning staff were incredibly polite and sweet though.On the Saturday a house music event was set up and when i say blasted, the music BLASTED out from around 2pm despite only 10 people being their until about 6.  There should have been volume control until people actually arrived. It ruined the day and i like housemusic. Also, i had booked two sea view rooms; one was exactly what we wanted, sea facing, the other faced out to the car park and along the park alongside the sea front.  Yes, we could see the sea, but it was out of the corner of the window and the noise was predominantly traffic."
Can not say enough about this place. They hit the mark every time. Wonderful staff and management respecting this beautiful hotel by being the best the can be. Loved every moment. Excellent location. The best.
"The one single thing I could say is, that like everywhere in Sri Lanka the beer could have been a touch colder."
"The pool party made our stay unbearable. We were informed that on our second night there would be a pool party and therefore the pool would remain closed. What we were not told was that the noise, vibration and discomfort would remain for the full twelve hours, noon till midnight. We were fed up, left the hotel for several hours and came back to the torture as we had a flight to catch in the morning. I don't think i will be staying at this hotel again.The staff were polite but not very knowledgeable. they had no idea how i could comment on the hotel and its services. When i asked for 2 postcards to be mailed, they simply gave me the stamps and charged me. All 5* hotels i have stayed at never charged and simply mailed the cards for me. i think the Galle Face has a lot to learn before they can be considered world class."
Hotel is well located near all good restaurant's. sea view was amazing. The staffs are very helpful.
"Friday till late night could hear from the room loud music going on the main floor was annoying. Spa,gem was under renovation which was not told at booking time was disappointing."
"Grand hotel with olde world ambience, good views"
"The extra 30% tax/service charges should have been disclosed up front - turns a $60 bottle of wine into an $80 one, the same goes for the room charge. No need to hide it and booking.com should consider that too as can be described as estimates. Shower had only one setting - boiling - the tap made no difference."
"Staff is good , selection of food"
"Room we were staying rather old fashion timber designWe prefer more modern roomDoors are quite heavy to openDoor key holewas rather low to openIroning board was too low to iron"
Definitely the breakfast was the best of our Galle Face experience.  A spectacular choice of fresh products from all over the world. The location is wonderful right in front of the beach. Great service as well. It is worth a 8 score just for that!
"Humidity, limited space in the standard rooms."
Service and food quality
Don't like Booking.com quoting only net and not actual price (plus 31% service charges & Govn tax).  Lets have real price.  Anything else is deception
"Staff were extremely accommodating and polite, couldn't fault them in any way. A massive plus was on our check out day, as the hotel wasn't that busy we were allowed to stay in our room for a couple of extra hours! Which made a world of difference to our plans."
Be careful with the alcohol- Not sure if what is written in the menu is a true reflection of the total price of the drink.
"The hotel is beautiful, but it is really old, and it smells old. The breakfast is okay but nothing amazing. It is located in front of the beach, reason why I booked this property. However, if you are looking to stay there, BE VERY CAREFUL WITH YOUR BELONGINGS - my two Pandora bracelets (worth more than 2,500 USD dollars were stolen from my room to be never found)."
"My two Pandora bracelets (worth more than 2,500 dollars) were stolen from my room)."
"Excellent breakfast options. Lovely room in the older part of the hotel (we had stayed in the newer section previously). Great pool. Great location - close proximity to Galle Face Green where we experienced some of the festivities for Poson Poya. A short walk to the tourist shopping area of the Dutch Hospital."
Transport options provided by the hotels private cars  (to the train station / hotel) are very over-priced. It's worth getting some numbers of companies and arranging this yourself.
"the breakfast was lovely .. the views of the ocean great. the hotel is lovely with its old architecture and good refurbishment. the overall ambience was lovely good location accessible to public transport and walking to many areas  wifi was good"
the bed was too hard for me
"The Galle Face hotel was absolutely beautiful, and the perfect way for us to end our stay in Sri Lanka. The staff were friendly and willing to help.Our room was lovely comfortable, very clean and furnished to a high standard.It was well located, on the sea front close to lots of great restaurants etc."
"The room was great, lovely products in the bathroom, the pool was wonderful after a day in the heat. I loved the sea breeze. The breakfast was AMAZING as were the cocktails. I wish we could have stayed longer."
Gym and spa were being renovated
This is an estate from another era. Great history and location
It's an old place that could use a renovation. Food was average nothing impressive. Spa and gym closed without any warning. We stayed at the junior ocean suite which was definitely overpriced.
Comfy beds.
Put us in a noisy  room to start with but moved us to a sea facing one. Staff weren't very friendly at all. No one to take our bags when we arrived. Not good considering it's supposed to be 5 star.
Gorgeous old world style. Amazing breakfasts. Amazing location overlooking the ocean. Great place to rest and retreat to after the craziness of colombo. Great 30m swimming pool. Loved it.
"Every thing was fairly good , staff , breakfast , bed comfort , location, wifi , TV channels , and above all front office staff who upgraded us to a suite which made our stay unforgettable."
Gym and Spa were under renovation and booking.com did not provide this information while booking.
"Great located beatiful hotel next to the sea (not for swimming). Felt like a dream. Perfect long pool. Good restaurants (lunch at Travellers Bar, diner at Sea Spray). Specious room. Best breakfast ever had ik a five star hotel. Stay in the hotel and do not get out for anything."
Fitness and spa were under construction during our stay (6th to 7th of May) so could not use them. Would have been better for a perfect five star hotel to have notified us at check in and maybe even give a small discount. Because our room was above the spa we heard loud drilling sounds for a half hour around 4:30 pm (which happened to be during our afternoon nap). Would also have been better to warn us in front and give us a choice for another room in case we would might some drilling sounds.
"The whole hotel was beautiful. Our rooms had a wonderful view and we appreciated the upgrade that let us enjoy adjoining rooms.Room service for our dinner was so good."
I had very clearly stated to Booking.Com and a separate mail was also sent to the property that I will be paying in cash and in the local currency. Inspite of this I was charged the $ tariff which is much higher than the tariff for local currency payment. I do not think that this is right.
"Sitting amongst the newer high rise hotels in Colombo, Galle Face Hotel still maintains its colonial character. The staff are immensely friendly and couldn't do enough for you and they take great pride in their jobs and the hotel. The pool is lovely! Although I somehow got it into my head that it was an inifinity pool, I was still pleasantly surprised! And the cocktails by the poolside were an added bonus.... particularly with the happy hour!! The breakfast was the best buffet breakfast I have ever had with a great selection of both continental, English and Sri Lankan choices! Oh and the fact that champers is included I was in my element! I thoroughly recommend the evening buffet too. Again, great selection cooked to a high standard. The rooms, although a little small, were still very comfortable."
Everything apart from the additional charges was great
"Premier Ocean View room was really large with a 'four poster' Jacuzzi as the centrepiece. Location at the South end of Galle Face Green was absolutely perfect for what we needed.Loved the daily ceremony of the bagpipes when the flag is lowered at sunset."
Slowish service in the main bar.
Hotel has an old world charm. The breakfast was excellent which much choice and champagne. A nice big cool salt water swimming pool. Lobby and breakfast areas were maintained beautifully.
Service at check in was poor. We were handed our key and pointed in the direction of our room. A hotel of this reputation should have staff to show us to our room and show us the facilities of the hotel.  The rooms are tired and do not seem to be maintained as well as their public areas. We also had booked a room for 3 adults and our room was set up for two people.  This was rectified by the hotel upon request.
"Pleasant and obliging staf ,Comfort and foodSpacious and well appointed with great ocean and sunset view.Ecellent bathroom and showerWide range of food available particularly at breakfast"

"We love the nostalgia and central location of this Iconic property, special thanks for the friendly service"
Beautiful hotel

"Very slow and cumbersome check in procedure, took 20 minutes."
"great location ,super service , fantastic old colonial building. nice large pool."
"not much choice of food,  no real beach to go to.  not good for children. basic rooms very small.you need to upgrade."
"Beautiful hotel overlooking the ocean.Many old pictures and artefacts.Upgraded to a suite which was extremely roomy and luxurious. Breakfasts were outstanding,dinner in 1864 and Buffet in Verandah also excellent.Great moment for a Scot to hear the bagpipes playing when the flag was taken down at 6 PM.- unbelievable!"
It was awesome stay in galle face. Really nice hotel. Over all staff is very good and caring. I was here only for one night. It was only bad feeling. I want more time to stay there. I am very disappointed just because i was wasted my 4 days in hotel galadari it was bad hotel. And hotel galle face was awesome.
"The hotel still retains some of the 'old' charm from a bygone era, although with mod cons. We seemed to get an upgrade, so our room was huge! Top floor, corner suite, and very well furnished. The pool area was great to watch the sun disappearing. The breakfast buffet was excellent, with lots of choice."
"Despite being on the top floor, our room was noisy until fairly late at night. The lift 'arrangements' are somewhat strange.....up in a lift, down a long corridor then up a flight of stairs to get to our room."
Location and the lobby
Poor service at the pool - over an hour to get a snack. Very few loungers at the pool. Check out confusion. Room not as described in Booking.com paperwork
Staff were great. Helpful and courteous. Everything I asked for was produced and their presentation was immaculatel.
A little slow with one meal at the travelers bar one night. Had to ask where my dessert was after a long wait.
Fabulous colonial era hotel.  Refurbishment now completed.  Fantastic location for this city.
Booking.com money transfer from GBP to USD to Sri Lankan Rupees was significantly diadvantageous on the bill!
A lovely old but modernised colonial hotel.  Breakfast in very nice outdoor restaurant overlooking the sea.  Staff are so friendly and helpful.  Very interesting to see photos of the many famous guests ...
Management have preserved a wonderfully British heritage by running an elegant and efficient establishment. It is a great pleasure to be a guest.
There truly was nothing at all to complain about. It rained a couple of days!
"Really nice rooms (had a junior suite but got upgraded to a suite). A special ""british colonies"" atmosphere that we only found in some indian hotels before.THE place to stay for a couple of nights in Colombo."
"May be the pool needs to be refreshed? Ask to stay in a renovated room, the old ones seem a bit outdated..."
"Beautiful historic buildingSunsets are really niceThe pool is ok"
"The room was very humid and smells of humidity which caused allergies and made it difficult to sleepThe staff is not friendly at all, especially compared to where we came from in TangalleThey also rarely understand what we were sayingThe hotel would not let us have a late check out supposedly because it was full that day. I was at the hotel all day and say very few people arrive, I am very confident they could have spared at least one room until 6pm, we had to wait for 5 hours without a room"
The hotel was lovely and the staff attentive. There was a lovely sunset.
The food was not great and we suffered from being there before and on Independence Day.
"This is the second time since January that we were enjoying Galle face hotel, I have no further comments.  We just like the hotel and will come back again."
It is a beautiful hotel which has maintained a wonderful colonial atmosphere and standard. It cannot be faulted in our eyes.
There was nothing to dislike. It really is a great hotel.
We stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms with balcony. Very comfortable.  The sun sets over the ocean each night perfect for cocktails by the pool bar - lovely service from the team there.
"The location beside Galle Face Green and close to the fort district, the great character of this great hotel with masses of space and first class service. The pool by the sea and the buffet breakfast. Everything works just right."
Beautiful hotel from 1864 with unique colonial character. Nicely situated by the sea which gives a nice sea breeze. Beautiful hotel rooms which are both spacious and nicely furnished. We had a wonderful terrace overlooking the saltwater pool. Many nice restaurants and very price worthy buffet for lunch and dinner. Definitely a place we would love to come back to if we have the chance!!
We liked everything
Beautiful location. Despite being a traditional hotel it has modernised very tastefully. the pool and leisure area was very safe and relaxing. Staff could not have been more friendly.
"Everything was clean except for the men's spa area, where the pools did not look well maintained."
"Lovely colonial style hotel, great buffet breakfast, very friendly staff. Free water and soft drinks in minibar very welcome. Good value cocktails at pool bar."
Room a bit small with limited storage for clothes. Door to adjoining room could limit privacy. Some parasols missing from pool area.
"The place as in overall is amazing, staff was very helpful and very friendly, The rooms are big , clean , comfy , facilities met my expectations, i would stay there again if i return back anytime. great experience overall and recommended."
As for my own experience i got nothing that bothered me during my stay.
"Everything about this hotel was amazing. Right from the llook and feel of the hotel (the palace feel), the surroundings, the staff, the breakfast, the wifi, eveything was top class."
Nothing.
It was clean & appealing to the eye
"I found the staff that manned the front desk a little rude, Very impersonal, didn't receive a welcome drink."
"Classic with class and a great pool.  Step back into history and enjoy luxury .  Enjoyed the veranda bar area with the sound of crashing surf.  A ""must visit"" as the grand old but carefully modernized colonial style hotel with fine traditions"
Should have more menu options instead buffets as there are few nearby restaurants.  Ocean bathing is prohibited.
"Beautiful building from days gone by. A real class hotel in a brilliant location with fantastic staff and a gorgeous classic room. Views at sunset were simply beautiful! The moment that we walked into the building we were treated so well! Staff also went the extra mile knowing it was our honeymoon which made the stay even more special. Also, we stayed over Christmas and was surprised to receive a chocolate santa in a stocking most mornings."
"Staying over Christmas meant that a lot of energy was put into the big day, but come Boxing Day, the staff were totally shattered (I don't blame them at all) and pretty much took their foot off the pedal. Was surprised at the breakfast buffet - quite disappointing! Egg hoppers were SO hard you could hear them snap. The guy at the egg station was all over the place every morning that we went there. Certainly room for improvement but it won't overshadow the wonderful experience of staying there!"
Hotel looks great. Rooms look great.
"The pool area stank of raw sewage, the staff in the bar were indifferent at best. The a la carte restuarant was overprieced, but nice enough. Between the sound of the aircon and the sea, we barely got any sleep. Don't get a seaview room, they're noisy and the windows are pretty small anyway."
The grandeur of the building and the location
Reception staff were hard work and check in was over-complicated. Had problem with final bill but eventually it was sorted out.
"The location and setting of the property was excellent. Th hotel has a very old world colonial feel to it, which is charming. Excellent for viewing sunsets."
The service was abysmall. The only factor pulling down this hotel is its service.
"The dimensions are palatial, and a welcome warmth from all the wood.  You will find things like libraries and wooden plank floors."
"Minor inconvenience: some air duct was causing vibrations in the wall, and ocean swimming is not allowed in that area."
"Loved the friendly staff, gorgeous rooms, stylish poolside and croquet! The food was also amazing and had fantastic views of the indian ocean. We were there on christmas day and particularly loved the decorations adorning the hotel, and the band playing during christmas lunch. The sunset scottish bagpipe player was also a lovely touch."
The pool area and our room seemed to take in some of the outside pollution (a sewerage smell) for a little while which I suspect came from whatever rubbish is being poured into the ocean. The smell eventually left our room but was constant near the pool area (less so if you sat on a sunbed closer to the outside bar).
The location was superb. It's an old hotel full of history but is very up to date. Absolutely stunning! The buffet evening meal and the breakfast were highlights of our trip.
Location by the sea and in town
That the price I had to pay was 25 % more than what booking.com quoted. I will not use booking.com again as your quotation did not include taxes and gave no indication of what these were. It would have been preferable to book directly with the hotel.
"The situation, especially the swimming pool, with the ocean waves crashing just feet below.  The historic feel to the place.  The view from our balcony room."
"The check-in experience - slow and cumbersome.  The buffet dining was expensive, and not that great."
"A classic hotel which only Asia can provide: old world character. Recently restored, the rooms and public areas are tasteful with great attention to detail. The food was excellent, all 3 buffet meals and the fabulous afternoon tea with scones and cucumber sandwiches. Excellent location and frankly amazing value for money at under $200 with a sea view room. (I am not sure one needs a sea view as most views, even of the courtyard are fine). We had no time to take advantage of the pool, spa, sauna, jacuzzi. The hotel museum is a nice touch and well worth a quick visit."
"Great location, fabulous view from the room, beautiful old hotel, great room service burgers."
"Room was not as luxurious as expected for the property, everything beige and muted. Extra taxes to pay (over 20%) not included in online room rate. Breakfast was extra on our deal and extremely poor quality (avoid unless you like a disappointing but expensive breakfast and a long queue for your omelette!), glad we only tried it once. Staff was just okay, not quite the high levels of service with a smile expected (I was expecting something like the Taj hotels)."
Location. Pool. Staff.
"Sauna is in very bad shape. No tourist information on display (Colombo has no attractions?!?). No tour/ travel agency offerings on display for comparison. I'm sure - one day, inshallah - noisy work around the hotel will be completed......."
Excellent location at the seafront. Colonial grandeur. Rich history. Very helpful and cheerful staff. The sounds of waves were amazing. Good reliable Wifi. Nice pool and spa.
None.
"Magnificent colonial hotelOn the ocean with lots of history.Breakfast fantasticGreat bars with views"
"We didn't get a room with a view  as requested."
"The location, the views and the history of the place was compelling and made for a very pleasant stay overall."
"Sadly, the service and attention one would usually equate with a 5-star hotel was not present. The large majority of staff were delightful and well-meaning, but seemed to be unfortatelely slow, the attention misplaced or they just didn't understand what was required."
"the view from the pool/bar is unbeatable! the breakfast buffet is amazing... food generally delicious, but not cheap!"
"we had a tiny, a bit noisy room towards the busy galle road."
"- The hot shower with very precise temperature controls.- The colonial architecture and history of the building"
The breakfast buffet was nothing to write home about....
"Sea view rooms make the experience. Other rooms are lovely and many are recently renovated, but seeing the ocean close up from one's bed (rather than a wall or nearby buildings) is worth the price hands down. The hotel is right on the sea (as close as one can be; there is no beach; just a sea wall), the staff are lovely and very accommodating, the food is very good, the location is in the heart of 'old Colombo' on Galle Face green, not far from the old Fort. The colonial ambience is charming (probably not to all ofcourse), there is a well-equipped gym, a spa and a salt-water pool, again, next to the sea. Wish I was still there!"
"Mostly loads of positives (see below!). Just a couple of other items: Though great deal of renovation has been completed, there seems to be a bit still underway so, some hammering during the day. Nothing too disturbing. Also - just FYI for management - we called the Hotel reservation desk directly and had a lengthy call trying to look into a booking.com reservation. Much of the call was honestly focusing on just trying to get my name fed back to me accurately, but then long silences. I had to enquire if the hotel reservations rep was still there. She was, but didn't seem sure what to say. After a few minutes, she finally said I need to call booking.com directly. Strange experience! Needs a bit of training and perhaps support in English language development. She was friendly though!"
The staff was very nice and helpfull. The hotel restaurant has an amazing view on the sea. The hotel is located in a nice area
The room we got was a little outdated and it had a terrible smell in the bathroom.
Great location. Lovely building. Fantastic food. Lovely friendly staff.
Noise from weddings but we were upgraded to larger room so it was dealt with well.
All would be great if the rates are cheaper when you consider you have to add mother 30% to the cost of the published rate
The extra tax and service charge make when you consider cost if the flights then you think .Spain
The hotel is marvellous. Wonderful building right on the sea front
Considering the price you pay for staying at this prestigious hotel the breakfast should be included in the price and there seen to be a lot of staff but still take and age to check in
"Location, building itself is great, nice service, friendly staff."
Room quite small. During visit reception moved causing some confusion and long walk to new reception.
Hotel staff were extremely helpful.  The hotel is in a great area where you can relax from the congestion and pace of the city.  I got sick while I was staying at the hotel and the hotel provided an excellent doctor who helped me recover.  The reception and staff were more than helpful during the entire stay and especially with providing room service while I was not feeling well.
Breakfast was very good but was not included with the rate.
"The location of this hotel is unbeatable, G&T on the big terrace by the ocean a must on any visit to Colombo. We took advantage of the food deal that came with the price and though we liked the lunch buffet, the dinner wasn't all that great and worth the price but it was convenient to just hang in the hotel for a day after a strenuous day of travel.The staff were friendly and the hotel oozes colonial atmosphere, though it's all polished and shiny now, not like it was when I first visited."
"The fact that the classic wing was closed for renovations, which reduced the hotel and our experience to only one side of the hotel. I had come here years ago and remembered the unique faded colonial atmosphere and had chosen to come again just for that. My mistake of course, I should have read the website more carefully and bad timing on my side."
"ServiceSuiteRoom serviceBeach bar"
The waterworks had waterhammer vibrations every time the WC was used. Aircon was too cold and had no thermostat control
Location was good
The room did not have enough lights. No newspapers were provided. Very old building and only one elevator. Overall I did not like and will not stay there again.
I loved the historic/heritage aspect of the hotel.
"Crows and chipmunks at the pool bar were annoying, but not something the hotel can really control.  Go at night and they won't be so bothersome!"
"Brilliant service! Not exactly a budget hotel but certainly delivers on all fronts. A problem at lunch was speedily resolved, the bill cancelled and what's more hotel manager came to our table at dinner to apologise and offer dinner on the house!"
No bad experiences.
"- Staff - were helpful & courteous - Food - especially room service- Facilities - pool and gym were brilliant"
- Wi-Fi although free was slow I'd expect better from such a good hotel in a city.
Nice views from some of the rooms.  Bar on the seafront is great. There is a refurbishment programme underway.  Free wifi and reasonably well equipped gym on site.
"Rooms looking a bit tired and sea view is interpreted fairly loosely.  Hotel car services are expensive, though efficient.  Spa area is large, but also a bit tired."
"Overall this is a very, very good hotel, boarding on a great hotel. A hotel where film stars, presidents and prime ministers have stayed. Dining room has photos of past famous guests."
"The electrical wiring was dodgy. Some power points worked, some didn't. Power went off to our room only for about 15 mins. Decor in dining room was not in keeping with the rest of the (colonial era) hotel. One wall had a hint of South American Aztec. But these are minor criticisms. It is a very good hotel."
"Great swimming pool, loungers overlooking the sea for the sunset, fantastic breakfast selection. Huge jacuzzi bath, colossal rooms, great location for walks along the front and a very handy shopping centre and food court across the road."
"The wifi in my ground floor room was an ongoing problem. In the end I had to rearrange the furniture to get a signal. Once I did that everything was fine, but then I had a desk across the bathroom door. Needs working on."
"Wonderful staff at a place that had everything you could imagine. Fantasticly service minded from the reception, to the restaurant and the pool bar. Great breakfast with lots of different choices and an amazingly comfy bed. Our flight wasn't until late so we could use the facilities in the spa during the night which was great. Also the guys who got you taxis and stored your bags were wonderful! Ten out of ten!!"
"Some of the pool guys stared a lot... Too much for working at a hotel that caters swimming pool and sunbeds. They should be used to girls in bikinis and respect that they don't someone to be staring at them while sunbathing (we were two sisters, this probably doesn't happen to couples)."
Excellent and personalized  service
"Apart from the excellent breakfast , the food served at the restaurant is quite poor in diversity and quality . Not at all at the high standard of the hotel and the service"
"My adult daughter and I spent one night and a late checkout day at the GFH at the end of our 2 week Sri Lankan trip.We loved everything about it!Staff VERY helpful, friendly, the breakfast super, the pool, the views, sunset, food and drinks at the Pool Bar. We had a deluxe room with an ocean view...just great!"
All excellent.
"We arrived extremely early but were allowed our room immediately. We did upgrade to a suite with a balcony- worth every extra dollar. we had 2 balconies overlooking the gardens and ocean. Wonderful. Loved the colonial charm, the hotel is beautifully maintained and loved the little museum. Would recommend room 2020 to couples and families."
Most rooms are without balconies although still well appointed and furnished.
"The dour faced accountant aside, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The location is great, the atmosphere historic and the food wonderful."
About two thirds of the hotel is currently under renovation. I especially regretted not being able to access the wide veranda overlooking the ocean. My room did not get much natural light which made it a bit dingy. The wifi was not strong which was a real nuisance when it came time to pay the bill by credit card as the hotel could not get acknowledgement from VISA and they were not going to allow me to walk out of there with just signing the chit.
"We upgraded to suite 2020, lovely room with 2 balconies overlooking the sea. Would recommend this room to couples or families as it had a separate tv area. The staff are welcoming and helpful. We arrived very early but no problems with going straight to our room. Loved the colonial feel and furnishings, extremely clean, loved the museum in the hotel. Poolside bar service great. Half of the hotel is being refurbished but it did not affect the running of the rest or the quality of our stay."
Nothing not to like.
"the swimming pool location is graetas well as the bar,rental cars of the hotel are expensive"
"not extra food in the meno, rental cars of the hotel, luxury"
Great colonial feel in the best position in Colombo. Excellent attentive service throughout the whole hotel. Older pool and outdoor areas but right on the ocean. Great food options especially breakfast.
Renovations that have been completed are in keeping with the style (and grace) of the hotel... staff are helpful and friendly... great location.
"Main part of the building is still being renovated, so much of the grandeur is yet to be unveiled. Not all the rooms in the renovated wing are of the same standard."
"The place has a feel of grandness, history and art. The moment you walk in, its breathtaking. The staff is absolutely wonderful with everyone giving you a smile and greetings."
"Superb view of Indian ocean from the room, jacuzzi in the room, spread of breakfast, champagne served with breakfast, the hotel museum, so impressive celebrity guest list."
nothing to dislike in this hotel
Excellent location next to the sea and Galle Face Green. An historic hotel with original features but sympathetically modernised. Large seawater pool and a bar and terrace to watch the sun go down. Pleasant and efficient staff. A large choice of dishes at breakfast.
The Wifi tended to come and go. There are more extras on the bill (service charges and taxes etc) than you get in Europe.
"Great room with spa bath in the middle of the room. Nice sea view. Fantastic breakfast buffet.Friendly staff."
Unfortunately the hotel was under renovation during our stay.
Perfect view. Great dinner! Very good breakfast for buffet. People are very nice and helpful.
The hot tub on our balcony was never addressed. I found out myself it was out of order.
"Lovely colonial atmosphere, great pool, friendly staff, our big room had spectacular view of the ocean, wonderful breakfast"
"Bad luck that the renovation was not finished, so the much appraised restaurants were closed"
The old colonial style of the hotel in a good location for downtown colombo. The room was spacious and very well appointed. Staff were very helpful and the food was good. Part of the hotel was being upgraded while we were there but it did not cause us any problems.
nothing
"Location, customer service, ambience"
"A very basic and disappointing curry in the restaurant, the hotel is rather overpriced for what it is. The wi-fi only works in the area near the reception"
"The exceptionally attentive staff. Not a detail missed, whether saying good morning or opening doors or ordering tuk tuks - we felt incredibly spoilt.The bed was very comfortable too!"
"Loved the gracious and elegant atmosphere. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The breakfast selections were outstanding. The rooms were large with high ceilings, good air con and big bathtubs."
The hotel is undergoing extensive renovation to the north wing but the hotel is doing an excellent job blocking off the area and keeping the noise level unobtrusive.
"The staff were welcoming and treated every guest the same whether they were rich, business, backpacker etc. The pool and pool bar overlook the sea and are perfect for sunsets. The hotel is steeped in history and is a proper treat."
"Beautiful wooden floors mean if a running, jumping child is in the room above yours it's a bit noisy!"
"The staff are lovely, considerate people. They remember you from your previous visits!Excellent breakfast fare in1864!"
"The thought that they may jack their prices sky high on completion of the renovation!1864 can get a bit frantic with everyone seemingly breakfasting at the same time."
"The staff at the hotel were so friendly and helpful, great location and good food."
Tried to get a drink at 11.45pm to be told by reception it was fine but to be told we couldn't at the  pool  bar only to be served in a hurried slapdash way.  Price of spa treatments expensive.
"The huge renovation is coming to a close but I'm delighted that the hotel has retained its old colonial charm. Sadly the time-honoured ""meeter and greeter"" , aged in his nineties died very recently, but the  hotel retained his services to the very end. The hotel general manager was attentive and nothing seemed too much trouble. We look forward to our next visit once the renovation has been completed."
"Loved the generous breakfast, with fresh fruits and plenty of option. The swimming pool with stunning seaview is fab"
We asked for a room with seaview and didn't get one. The service at the pool bar is bad: the waiters favours outside guests from hotel guests (45min to get our orders)
"The service is good in the restaurant although a bit slow at the bar outside.  But you have to remember things are a bit slower in Sri Lanka... The staff are super helpful and always smiling.The food in the restaurant 1860 is exceptionally good as is the breakfast buffet.   Highly recommended.They have the best pool in Colombo (not the biggest but with the best views for the sunset)."
"The experience at the spa was disappointing.  The bed wasn't clean and the arrival to room wasn't smooth and the girl couldn't see that the bed still had oil on it from the previous customer.   I have been to the Galleface 3 times and this experience wasn't at all what I've experienced in previous trips.The new taxi service, run by BMW (!) was extremely disappointing and not to the standard I have experienced before.  Poor English, drivers didn't know where they were going and expensive. You're better off using Kangaroo Taxis. But if you want a nice car then I guess they're good for that.  The hotel car services were much better before and in keeping with the hotel."
"LocationGorgeous view and terrace with the Balcony Suite"
"2 power outages in the course of the night meant no A/C in our room and made for a restless night.After a week travelling around Sri Lanka this was the first place where we felt ill after visiting the restaurant."
Location and staff
The rooms were such a let down. The exterior teases with pomp and opulence until you get into the room which is basic at best. The biggest disappointment on our trip to SriLanka. Expecting Raffles and got Ibis.
"Lovely helpful staff. Rooms are very comfortable and well maintained. Food was good, though maybe a little expensive for what it was. Great location for sea and visiting attractions and shops. The old school colonial feel is abundant in all areas of the hotel. It manages to remain un corporate as many hotels now feel like business hotels in Colombo. On the whole a good choice of hotel to mark ones arrival in Sri Lanka."
"Shame that so much building work is going on, but that cannot be helped. Noise was at a minimum. Wifi could be intermittent but that is general to Sri Lanka."
The best place we stayed in Sri Lanka.
Price was definitely on the high end.
"wonderful staff, so well looked after. they really care for their guests."
Perfect place to stay in Colombo overlooking the ocean and away from the chaos
Service in Long Room excellent.
Property and staff was great
Room size was to small. Should mention room dimensions at booking stage
"Breakfast in the Verandah BarSalt water pool + pool barCocktails at the Travellers BarFriendly and efficient staffGrand and beautiful hotel"
"Room size (superior room)Old style furniture Buffet (dinner and breakfast)"
Whirlpool didn't work
A really pleasant experience in beautiful building with helpful staff
Our  room didn't have the view promised but we were moved the next day
We stayed in 5 hotels in Sri Lanka and this was the best one! Such a wonderful character.
All perfect
Beautiful location and fascinating historical building. The service was  elegant but not uncomfortable.
Lovely old hotel with a good range of eating options. Very easy to get around and find things.
Excellent service and a nice hotel right on the water.
You pay for the experience - possibly there are other options a bit cheaper in Colombo.
"Great place, location and facilities."
Request a non smoking room as some can be a little stinky.
Pool.  Choice of food.  Sea front location.  The building itself is stunning.
Room was not ready at check in time.
The beach front and the sunsets
The bold pool man who was rude and not helpful.
Good location and a beautiful property with a great view!
Terrible service and average food!
Absolute spoiling
Having to leave
Food was excellent!
Superior room with ocean view definitely didn't match our expectations though - very little view of the ocean!

construction work being completed
we were very well taken care of in everyway. beautifully restored hotel.  we will definately stay here on our next visit to Columbo.
Great location and the library
No Balcony in the rooms and only one chair in the room.  Can hear the neighbouring room occupants.
"Great location, classic old hotel, extremely good service, great sunset views."
Loved the feel of the hotel and the friendliness of the staff
Had to wait 1 and half hour for burger to arrive at beachbar. No problems in restaurants
Very good breakfast. Professional staff. Very stilish hotel even if a small refresh would help.

"The old colonial feeling. The whole buildings,  swimming pool, restaurants, the walk along the beach and hip vibe at night."
They don't have local cuisine that we wanted to have before leaving the country. The room is very small considering the value.
Loved this hotel! The staff couldn't have been more helpful or friendly. The breakfast was amazing - probably 1 of the best buffets I have had.
It was very quiet but this was because of the recent Easter Sunday bombings
"Loved the enormous salt water pool,, and the breakfasts , especially the freshly made hoppers I usually sat a little longer with an extra pot of chai overlooking the sea,, nothing was a problem. And brilliant front desk and concierge service"
"Such a lovely stay at the hotel. We arrived just after the terrible news on Colombo and despite having army personnel around the hotel, the staff were so amazing at making us feel safe and at ease. As it was our honeymoon, the staff upgraded our room and sent bubbles and chocolates to our room which was a lovely touch. The room service was also so prompt and tasty. We’re planning on returning in the future to spend more time here. Thank you to everyone at the Galle Face for being so lovely at a time of tragedy for Sri Lanka."
"The breakfast was incredible, the staff beyond helpful and the bedrooms were lovely. It was a truly great stay and I would definitely stay again."
"I don't have a bad word to say about the Galle Face Hotel, we loved every minute."
The history is amazing and the place is huge and beautifully presented. the pool is great and th eoptions for drinks and food are really good. Location is also perfect.

"Staying here made for a wonderful first night in Sri Lanka. A gorgeous historic building that has been looked after so well. Lovely rooms, incredible evening buffet eaten under the stars, a fun Cuban bar on site to watch the sunset and a lovely clean pool. Wonderful location too!"

"Breakfast was very good and varied as would have been expected from a 5 star hotel. Bed was comfortablePool was excellent overlooking the sea - lovely to relax and hear the waves lapping. Staff were incredible helpful and always willing to help even organising a taxi for us at the end for the airport. We did not use the hotel's cars which would have cost $70 to the airport and instead used  Kangroo Cabs which cost 3000 rupees."
"For what we paid, I was expecting a nicer room. Although we got one of the cheapest rooms, we still paid £165 a night for a basic room and breakfast - with a view over a unused courtyard and building which had paint peeling off its walls.  We had stayed in much nicer rooms throughout our stay, but I understand that you are paying for the location and to stay in a piece of history. One night we went to the hotels Cuban restaurant, My partner is vegan and even though vegan options were given, the food was bland and tasteless and we ended up spending £28 for 4 small plates and 2 mock-tails. I would not recommend eating there!"
"Beautiful colonial hotel close to the seafront. Wonderfully restored to its former beauty. Great spacious and well-appointed rooms, excellent breakfast and dinner. Superlative staff with great service!"
"Perhaps a little pricy, but worth it."
"An amazing place to stay in Colombo- friendly staff, incredible food, plenty of history to enjoy in a place that oozes style and takes you back in time.  Definitely recommend it!"
nothing- I wish I could afford to stay there longer!!!
The greeting was great the room was good. Complementary fridge and a great house keeper. Loved the salt water pool.
Holes in pool decking that could cause injury
The property is beautiful and the staff is amazing and they even bring you fresh water bottles and fruit in the swimming poll. The breakfast is great.
Rooms are old but well mantained. Could use an update. We had a balcony and what we could see: another building...
"This place is a living heritage museum, celebrating bygone eras. Staying here is a must on your visit to Sri Lanka. The building is beautiful and classic, the service friendly and helpful, the food and drinks delicious. I strongly recommend having sundowner drinks in the courtyard and watching the bagpiper play as the Sri Lankan flag is lowered at sunset - what a remarkable experience!"
The hotel is an iconic place. So much history! En joy the historic tour of the hotel to get the best historic insight of the property.
Pity the harbour and big buildings are coming towards the hotel...
A wonderful hotel in every sense enhanced by fantastic staff. Colonial style with grand staircases and wood panelling. Staying here is a unique experience. There are plenty of marble palaces nearby but once inside you could be in any city in the world. The Galle Face Hotel is Colombo.
Nothing to dislike.
The staff. The welcome and check in process. Having complimentary minibar items and welcome snacks. The happy hour snacks were delicious. The ocean view from the room along with the sound of waves crashing on the property's beach. The outside seating area of the restaurants by the beach. The suite size. The TV was big.
"The hotel is old but not in a charming way. It looks like it needs renovation. The carpets need replacement (they look dirty), the wood needs polishing and the wall needs painting. Some areas of the hotel smelled like sewers and some of the towels in the toilet looked so worn out."
"The hotel is very colonial - it literally breathes the history of older times. It is truly one of the main places to see in Colombo, we highly recommend it for a stay in the city. We stayed for one night on our way back home and we really regreted not staying there longer.The staff are AMAZING - welcoming, helpful, discreet. You truly feel the luxury and the tradition of quality. This hotel is a city within a city - there are so many things you can do - 4 amazing restaurants, splendid front line sea view pool with salt water, bars with an exciting selection of drinks, spa area, museum (how crazy is that?!:)), wime cellar.. Special thanks to the manager who gave us an upgrade and a complimentary early check-in. We were surprised that the hotel managed to overcome our expectations! Will definitely stay again."
I liked the food. The burger was excellent on the veranda. We also went to the 1864 French restaurant and the steaks were very good. Service was impeccable and all in all a great experience and end to our holiday.
Curtains weren’t quite fitting the windows which was annoying in the morning.
Huge room and you can hear the waves when you open the windows. Great breakfast and iconic sunset
"The hotel is a bit tired and our room looked like t hadn’t been used in a while. The staff was very quick in fixing it, but We let we had better experience in significantly cheaper places."
Old colonial hotel with memories of days gone by!
"Our room was in a wing on the side, however the passage was noisy with people walking and we could hear doors banging! It is a beautiful old quaint colonial hotel, as such the floor creek etc"
Have stayed here many times. The hotel has refurbished and improved consistently over the years. I can't imagine staying somewhere else in Colombo.
"The room was great the staff was friendly and professional. We had high tea with invited friends rather than dinner which was fantastic.
"
Nothing. Everything was perfect.
"Nice, big hotel with history. Beautiful terrace to enjoy a drink. Breakfast was vast and lovely. Nice pool overlooking the ocean."
Our room was okay but not as beautiful as where we stayed before here. 
"Great location, just a few metres from Fort wall and beach with views of wall and beach from balcony. Generous and tasty breakfast.
Friendly hosts who kindly offered to do a load of washing for us at no additional fee."
Nothing
"An exceptional colonial hotel with up to the second amenities. Wonderful staff providing excellent service.  Great choice of food and drinks, a truly fantastic place to stay in Sri Lanka. "
If you can fault this hotel in any way I’d be utterly surprised. 
Everything about this beautiful hotel is perfect. The staff are wonderful. The breakfast is superb and the atmosphere/buildings are excellent. I will always return here when I come back to Colombo!
The location right on the water is stunning.  It was lovely to sit by the pool and overlook the ocean and have the waves crashing right there.  It doesn't get much more beautiful than this.  It is also very close to any restaurant or site you want to visit in Colombo.  The buffet breakfast was also quite delicious.  The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay.
"Galla Face is a total refuge from the chaos that is Columbo. Lovely setting and sunset views, kind and very attentive staff, very good food - breakfast will be an abiding memory of our trip. The hotel is old school elegance and calm. It’s a big place but never feels frenetic or over busy. You feel slightly like you’re in an episode of Jewel in the Crown - a real experience and we were delighted to top and tail our Sri Lanka trip here."
"Honestly, not a thing."
"Liked the always helpful staff. The location was excellentTheir Fine dinning restaurant was superb"
NOISE....late night loud Thump Thump music from lower floor ...which made me angry as on booking I specified a quiet room ..the hotel replied and said for my 3 night stay I would have a quiet room...it wasn’t quiet at all. Buffet restaurant needs an overhaul on food selection and presentation.
Really enjoyed our stay. The amount of food to choose from in the buffet was amazing. Staff very helpful and friendly. Room was good and pool area very nice.
A room with a balcony would have been nice but overall good
The hotel was everything i expected. I was there for the Ironman race and i was welcomed the minute i stepped in the door despite turning up with my bike and all my kit. The rooms are great. The hotel is steeped in history and this is reflected in every aspect of the place. I would highly recommend it when you are in Colombo. I fell asleep to the sound of the sea!!
"nothing, i loved it"
"Location, swimming pool, atmospheric old colonial hotel, with a wonderful museum over the history of the hotel. The sunset, the lowering of the Sri Lankan flag at sunset."
"It was a very different experience of living in old colonial hotel on the coast of a bustling city of Colombo.  I did not have too much opportunity to explore the city (I only saw if from the window of the car going to work), instead I took the time to explore the hotel itself and it was an adventure.  For those of you who enjoy historical places, this hotel has a lot to offer!  It is worth to talk to the staff members about the history of the place an some slightly quirky rituals that the guests will surely witness :).   Even if the hotel itself is over 150 years old, it offeres all modern facilities.  I greatly appreciated the fact that the rooms are equipped with old-fashioned ceiling fans as well as the air conditioning.   This way I had a choice not to use the later and still stay cool in the room.  The breakfast buffet is excellent with a large choice of diverse dishes - both local, Western and also some Oriental.   Overally it is a good hotel for those, who want to stay in a place which is differnet from the modern Western style business hotels."
"Beautiful old colonial hotels. Great facilities, lovely big pool. Nice pool bar and Cuban restaurant. Drinks quite pricey compared to other hotels we stayed at in Sri Lanka.
Huge bedroom."
Silly light system all controlled from a key pad that you can’t see in the night! Difficult to find a light switch to actually turn on! Air con was also difficult to use and so our room hot overnight.
"The ambience of the historic past, the building, the rooms, the location - all great"
"Many groups of tourists, and the fact that the hotel misses a few ‘younger’ propositions - Cuban bar a good start... terrace area, long room can do with more of the same.... how can you make the hotel more interesting for younger  clientele?!
"
"Again an old colonial style hotel . Rooms we stayed in were tired and a bit rough around the edges, I believe they are in the process of updating the rooms.With tax and service charge added on , prices for drinks, spa treatments and food were similar to western hotel prices. Nice salt water pool.Pool bar area good for watching sunsets, Sri Lankan piper announces sunset , and sri lankan flag  lowered overnight.Good breakfast buffets."
"Some mildew and fungus on wood in bathroom ,  manager told us  he would move us, but hotel full . Didn""t here any more from him and remained in same room. However they did scrape above off the wood !"
"There was a fantastic welcome as we arrived in the morning the staff went out of their way to get our room ready earlier so we didn't have to wait until check in. Everyone was very friendly and provided fantastic customer service, nothing was too much trouble. Thank you for making the start of my holiday in Sri Lanka one to remember."
"With a short notice, the hotel arrange to send me a vehicle to the airport to pick me up."
"In the check-in, the staff in the front desk assigned me  a room which is less than what I paid for.Upon bringing this issue to management, I was giving the right one."
Swimming pool and restaurants The Verandah and the Cuban by the sea
"Room was on 4th floor in one corner facing a tower with a soldier with weapon. It was big but old, bathroom had a leak. Old room old aisle."
Fantastic historic hotel. First class accommodation.  Pillows / bed great. View of property & ocean sensational. Breakfast buffet very nice.  Staff plentiful. Pool excellent.  Cheap tuk tuk to markets or shops in Colombo.
Can’t think of any.
On the seafront but unable to swim in the sea.  Very efficient and friendly staff. Ok location. Access to many local hotel restaurants.  Complementary soft drinks and snacksin the room fridge. Hotel Cuban bar lively with good cocktails. 30m swimming pool with salt water. Spa and gym facilities good.
"No view from our room. Lots of building projects nearby, but this did not affect our hotel stay."
"Colonial grandeur - a delight to stay in this beautiful heritage building with such a rich history. Gin and tonic on the beachfront, a swim in the pool and a Sri Lankan curry buffet for dinner. Heaven! I never opened a door the whole time I stayed there. Staff were very attentive and friendly."
There was not a single thing to complain about.
"The staff were great, nothing was a problem. The breakfast is fantastic. The pool is clean and amazing spot for watching the sunset "
The lunch wasn’t great 
"A historical and traditional hotel, beautiful place and wondelful property. The renovation is made very well, they have not destroyed the feeling of the palace. The room was big and well equipped. The staff is professional. We got very good dinners in the special restaurants and the selection of wines is huge."
"We had to wait more than half an hour before we got the room even that we arrived after 2 in the afternoon. They just forgot us sitting on the sofa. The buffetrestaurant is too big and restless, it was not nice to have at least breakfast there."
"We were very impressed with the check-in service. We arrived slightly early and were able to check-in after a short wait. The hotel is beautiful, in a perfect sea-front location and feels like stepping back into a long-gone colonial era. The room (junior suite) was beautifully appointed with two sea-view balconies, a feature jacuzzi bath and very comfortable bed."
"Unfortunately we were disappointed by the restaurant experience. We were staying at the hotel to mark a special occasion and I had made a dinner reservation at the Verandah at the time of booking. Upon arriving at the restaurant we were informed that it was buffet only that night (no a la carte) due to a private function in another restaurant. I felt the hotel could have communicated this at the time of booking, which would have given me the opportunity to make alternative arrangements. It also created issues for bathroom use as the usual bathrooms were off limits due to the private function, so we had to go up to L1 for the bathroom, which caused a further inconvenience to us and was disruptive to our special dinner. I felt the hotel prioritized the private function at the expense of other guests' experience, and I have to say this is not what I expected from this hotel. In addition, the buffet itself was not great, so what was supposed to be a special evening was a disappointment."
Love the location by the sea. Friendly staff. Amazing breakfast buffet.  Great massage at the spa.
Was offered a rubbish room with noisy road outside. I was upgraded after a little time so it worked out ok in the end.
"This beautiful, stylish hotel had no faults in my opinion; the restaurants and bars are diverse and excellent, the staff are charming and helpful, the building is magnificent  and even the small museum (housing, aming other things The Duke of Edinburgh's first ever car!). The museum also lists some of the previous guests at the hotel, including Cole Porter, Mark Twain, Noel Coward, Laurenve Olivier, Duke Ellington and Scarlett Johansson.  There's not much to be said for Colombo, so it's just as well that you feel like hanging around the hotel all day!"
"We came in late desk duty were very curtious and efficient, bell staff were the same and then on top of that we were upgraded to a sea view suite wonderful way to wake up in the morning.Thankyou"
Old colonial style atmosphere. Bedroom comfortable and beautiful.
"No view whatsoever from bedroom.Slow service in bar area during lunch time. Quality of food served during the various buffet services and the seating ambiance of the restaurant could be much better."
Despite being a large hotel the staff still make it feel very friendly. The fact that the hotel has its own seafront and has retained its sense of its history makes it feel quite special.  The hotel catering was excellent.
"The best hotel in Colombo, and probably in all  Sri Lanka
Colonial atmosphere,  perfect service, and excellent breakfast"
Cost much more than the alternatives
"The bathroom was perfect, the room very comfortable, even had views. The pool and pool area was wonderful."
Breakfast not included. Otherwise there was nothing to not like!
Airport pick up service was excellent.  Beautiful breakfast on the veranda. Tried the Siri Lankan specialities.   Had great tea with pastries.
Our stay was to short.
"This hotel is over 150 years old and it is well reflected in the overal ambience.  For travellers who like hotels with the difference, it is a very pleasant experience.   Even a tour around the hotel is like sightseeing.   I also liked the location.  Right by the sea [althought the beach is not large], a great position to watch sunsets.  It is also close to a busy city promenade where you can immerse yourself in Colombo's life, so different from the slightly posh atmosphere of the hotel.Breakfast it very good.  A wide range - local and European food.  Very fresh and tasty.  Meals are served on the verandah which allows to feel the warmth and sea breeze.   Hotel has few bars, including a latino bar with life music.  The rooms have fans as well as air conditioners.  Fans are bit noisy sometimes, but for those who can't stand air conditioning this is a good alternative.  Staff is very helpful and patient.  Like everywhere in Sri Lanka.  Overall, definitely a very pleasant experience."
Sometimes I felt I was getting too much attention.   But this is just a cultural difference :)
"Beautiful historical hotel that has been well maintained. The location, staff, facilities (especially the pool) were all fantastic and deserving of the 5 star rating. Thank you for such a wonderful stay. "
Nothing! 
"Galle Face Hotel is one of the iconic hotels of the past and lives up to its reputation. Compares to Raffles, Eastern & Oriental and Peninsular hotels."
My only criticism is that Colombo itself does not provide enough interest to support a lengthy stay at the hotel.
"Everything you’d expect to find in an historic hotel like this. Staff amazing, great facilities, room well presented and restaurants/bar good too. Enjoyed our stay!"
"Unfortunately some ants had made there way into the mini bar, but this was quickly rectified by house keeping and the contents replaced (so not really an issue). "
"I’m struggling to think of positives. The hotel was ok, nothing special stands out."
"The waiting staff were sometimes attentive and other times completely ignored you. It was really hit and miss. We stayed in 8 other hotels during our tour of Sri Lanka and experienced far better service elsewhere.
The food is overpriced and mediocre. Again we had much better food elsewhere on our Sri Lankan travels for less than half the price.
The pool is small for a hotel of this size and there are not enough sun beds.
The room appeared clean at first glance, but look again and you can see that the rug hadn’t been hovered etc.
We could also hear noises from outside which disturbed our sleep.
We will look to book elsewhere next time we are in Colombo and I would advise you do the same. I couldn’t recommend this hotel."
"Great location by the water, equipped with a gym, spa and pool.  Love the Veranda area! Love the breakfast spread! Service with a smile! "
If staying during the week of national day beware of parade and celebrations that result in road blocks in the morning til lunch time.  If you arrange for driver I find they themselves along with hotel do lot know how bad traffic will be or when Road will clear.
Very grand hotel. Historical features still in place. Good selection of bars and restaurants on site. Nice pool size which was not over crowded. Staff were attentive and well mannered.
"Noise from room above very loud due to wooden flooring and furniture if moved above and also noise in corridor travels very far. Room was small, basic and in need of a touch up especially considering the grandeur of the hotel."
"This is an historic and elegant hotel which is fully updated while retaining much of its historic character. It is in a stunning position right on the coast.  The staff are plentiful and accommodating, food is good and there are a number of restaurants to choose from, breakfast was an extensive buffet featuring european and Sri Lankan dishes.  We used the hotel three times as a base in Colombo on our trip and would use it again"
"One of the rooms we stayed in, while having great views, was situated above a bar which played music late at night.  On the plus side, when we complained to the management about our disturbed night, they acted promptly to ensure that we were given a quiet room for our next night at the hotel."
Very good breakfast buffet. Helpful smiling staff. Good location. Easy to get passing taxis and tuk tuks. Interesting little museum with Prince Phillip's car. Attractive general areas.
Awful bare unattractive small room. Only one bedside light. Basic overhead shower. No bath. Tiny bottles of cheap shampoo etc. Room not cleaned by 4 pm so just obtained replacement towels from passing cleaner. Towels thin and frayed.  Bar food was served cold and soggy
All the magnificence of a grand colonial hotel. This property is well maintained with modern facilities but retains its grandeur & elegance.
Gluten Free bread was disappointing.
the breakfast spread was vast and really good! the view from the pool-side bar & dining is simply spectacular
"floor boards were creaking :) it was charming for us, not sure about the neighbors on the below floor!"
Fantastic old hotel in excellent location. Comfortable bed in lovely large room. Overall the hotel seems caught between being an axclusive first class hotel and a mass market offer. Loved the sea views and the history of the place. Sense of fading grandeur.
Air conditioning in room could not be adjusted. Very noisy and much too cold. Bathroom ok but in need if upgrade to be first class. The hotel falls between premier and mass market. It would need an upgrade to be the former but is too expensive to work as the latter.
"Bar and restaurants were excellent,  especially the Cuban bar.  The love music the was fantastic!!"
"Rooms were a bit dated, but designed to look authentic for time period. "
"Great food, good service, lovely historical feel of the hotel.Pool and location cannot be better!"
"We had a very annoying check-in at 1am in the morning (room not ready and had to wait until 2am) - however, manager apologized next day"
amazing views/location and front of house facilities - Restaurant/breakfast on site - Simply stunning !
The bedrooms ! very ol/tired and in need of a refresh
I’ve stayed there several times and always loved the old colonial style and rated it v highly . Vg cocktails and staff too
"Since last year I feel it had gone down hill . They kindly upgraded my room so no complaints but glad only there one night as view over back and roof tops and room nothing to pontificate about , so no major advantage ,whereas before I had a view over sea, front and Galle face green. Also little things like soap dish chipped in bathroom, lighting not great. Breakfast buffet deteriorated , choice more limited and had run out of emmental cheese which one doesn’t expect of hotel of this calibre No idea about dinner buffet . Dined at Cuban restaurant instead but sad seaspray had gone. Overall seems a bit scruffy compared to my previous stays."
"The ambience of this place and the attention to detail was extraordinary. The Royal Dutch suite was truly luxurious with views over the water, and the complimentary chocolates to recognise wedding anniversary, as well as upgrade to access pre-dinner champagne and canapes in the Long Room, while watching a beautiful sunset was truly memorable. The swimming pool and pool service was second to none. The Library is well worth a visit too. Wished we could have stayed longer..."
Nothing at all.
"Pleasant dinning, great staff, good location. Good live band one night."
"Paid for a deluxe queen room. Room was small,view of a dirty ally-way,and showed its age.,"
"Colonial history, design and location. Cuban restaurant was excellent and great fun with excellent staff"
"The evening we were there there was a major corporate event which dominated the main ding area and bar area. The majority of the terrace was closed to residents and the music was over bearing and far too intrusive.It is quite simply that paying guest enjoyment should be compromised in this way. We should have been warned and the room rate reduced as we were unable to use all the facilities advertised and the event took over the whole outside area.The outside bar area lacks atmosphere and just doesn't feel right when it should be brilliant. More thought is needed on the detail to create a truly colonial feel.I do not think buffet service for Dinner in the main terrace restaurant is what one expects of a international hotel. Bit like being at a Club Med resort."
"We had a wonderful stay in the Galle Face during pre-christmas time. A fantastic feeling in the traditional house. Scenic view, friendly staff and beautiful colonial style decoration. Love it!"
"The room was a bit oldish decorated for such a traditional house it is a pitty. The food was average, with a bit too much Sri Lankan taste."
"The location of the landmark hotel is brilliant. as well as the history. The management is there poor. Rather uncomfortable for the lady travellers. No personal touch, no guest relation appointed managers we met. no welcome we have experienced. as much as we regret."
Location is brilliant as well as an atmosphere of the landmark hotel and the ambience. When service is missing....
The old world charm but still new looking.
I booked through booking.com. Reception somehow missed that I had alreadypaid for 2 of the 3 rooms I’d booked and accidentally charged twice for one room. This could have easily been avoided if record keeping was done well. There was unnecessary hassle caused at check out.
Gorgeous heritage property thar takes you back in time. Delightfully luxurious as well and stunning location.
Can’t think of anything other than a temporary mix up about our booking at check in. Communications between booking.com and the hotel should’ve been clearer and more prompt.
Excellent location very comfortable and clean. Staff very accommodating. Colonial Architecture just Brilliant. Loved breakfast on the veranda. Drinks in the Evening at the alfresco Cuban bar a must .
Air conditioning wasn’t working properly in our room however the technicians fixed the problem almost immediately.
Fabulous location and a very comfortable and stylish hotel.  Works as a place to relax as well as visit the city.
"The reception desk were a bit unwelcoming - it was sunset and the hotel has a tradition of 'piping' down the sun which is fun to view.  Our receptionist messed around and never said 'welcome' and we pretty much missed it.  Poor training for a hotel of such quality, but I stress that wasnt true of all the reception staff."
"Location - you can walk nearly to every landmark in the city. 
The swimming pool nearly at the beach. 
Choice of restaurants and bars (yet the speed of service could be improved, especiallly at King of the Mambo!)
Friendly and helpfull staff!
You should try the spa offer, especially the massage (ask for firm tratment and leave really relaxed)"
"Room was rather loud, mainly due to not sound proofed doors, with a lot of noises coming from the corridor - source were guests but also housekeeping employees, active early morning (6-8 AM) - we couldn’t sleep well
Bad smell as a result of humidity (in the room and some of the public spaces)
The price of airport pick-up / drop-off servcie is above average (even comparing to the Blacklane package of comparable car standard)"
"Location is very central and unique as the garden is directly on the seafront (most other main hotels are separated by the main road). The swimming pool is spacious (40 m) & uses sea water. Direct view of sunset. 
Breakfast spread is varied and well presented. The common areas have maintained some of the original style of this historic hotel. Excellent clean & modern gym. "
Rooms Are a bit dated and would need an upgrade. Wooden floors tend to be noisy despite carpet flooring. 
Manager was not welcoming or service-oriented when receiving us at the hotel and discussing the room rates. Not the gracious service typical of 5 star properties.
"Facilities and decoration transport you to the early 20th century. Pool, restaurant and bars are well decorated and are perfect to spend days, weeks, months"
"Elevators on the back section could be better maintained. Other than that, there’s nothing else I didn’t like"
"Beautiful Colonial-era building, everything was immaculate and food was excellent. The whole look, feel and atmosphere was wonderful. Rooms are decorated in keeping with the era. Service is top class."
Room rate was fairly high but it was peak Christmas & New Year season so to be expected I suppose.
Right on the sea front. The building holds so many historical features and it is beautiful.
The meals and drinks menu is not clear about tax not being included so final bill almost doubles.
Good terrace overlooking the water for food and cocktails
Wasn’t allocated the room I requested. The room smelled of damp and little concern showed by staff to resolve. Eventually I was moved but not without a fight which was a real shame.
Property itself was beautiful and the staff very nice
"Taxes are not included in the room rate or any of the menus, when booking this should be clearer as was much more expensive than advertised. "
"The location is great, easy to walk to the old Dutch hospital development, or the shops at Crescat. A short tuk tuk ride to Barefoot, Paradise Rd and The Gallery Cafe."
Nothing.
"it’s a beautiful old hotel and fun. With lots of friendly efficient staff. Chanaka on reception particularly helpful. I needed him to print a contract, to sign and then them to scan it back to me... which they did without fuss and very quickly 😀"
"Nothing.. it’s a beautiful old hotel and fun. With lots of friendly efficient staff. Chanaka on reception particularly helpful. I needed him to print a contract, to sign and then them to scan it back to me... which they did without fuss and very quickly 😀"
"A wonderful historical experience. Charming and elegant. The real Surprise was the King of Mambo downstairs and outside on the lawn. It is a must for any visitor. great atmosphere, food and setting, and lounges."
nothing
Good hotel for our short stay in Colombo. Great location as very close to local Laksalas for shopping and to other tourist spots.
Room was not well-lit
A nostalgic visit had not been to Galle Face since 1959/60 or thereabouts. The resident historian gave a run down on the changes since then. 
Nothing to say all good
"It is  a great hotel. The service, the staff, the look and fell...  Everything is simply excellent."
"The only downside is that it is fits for couples. If the staying is surfing purposes, I would not recommend stay there (especially with kids - the hotel doesn't fit for kids).If you have honeymoon or just want to relax as a couple, this is exactly the place to do so!!!"
"Beautiful setting, traditional colonial style really enjoyed our stay. Food and drink reasonably priced for this star hotel. We were upgraded to a suite which was amazing."
"Dirty bath, black bits in water when Jacuzzi was used "
"The hotel's charm is unparalleled. The location is unbeatable. Old world hospitality, lovely nooks and crannies across the property and lovingly preserved traditions. Great front desk experience."
"Still scope for improvement in housekeeping services, room upkeep. Hotel cab rates are way above normally paid around Colombo. Tighter management overall will help."
Great location and colonial vibe
Food at beach bar was very average. Chicken satay served undercooked and slightly pink. Staff very helpful and ordered again but still under cooked.
"The heritage hotel is a realGem. Loved aperil spritz on the verandah viwwimng the sunset and the taking down of the flag with bagpipes in tow. Truly moving"
Nothing
"1. All extra comfy!2. Scent of the hotel!3. staff always brings you in person when you are lost! 4. Hotel car always ready in a span of short call 5. Concierge really looks after your messages6. All smile happy staff7. Relax environment8. Management runs towards you when there is an issue not run away fromyou9. The old wood floor10.  The black and white photos in the museum who visited the hotel since it opened.  Including so many royal families and politicians and US presidents and James Bond actors 11.  Sunset ceremony12. the breeze"
"additional telephone for bigger rooms and I have to run to answer the phone.  If I was sleeping, I cannot go back to sleep coz I had to answer the door or the phone by the time I go back to bed I am awake!  Need Chargers at the bar!  Sound system improvement and spa needs improvement"
"Has so much potential to be a great hotel. However the building is run down, customer service staff have very little concept on what they are doing and at times rude and unhelpful. Food selection in restaurants was poor. Seems to cater for a primarily middle age British holiday maker demographic with pre purchased holiday packages.Also had an awful experience with some missing jewellery that had been delivered for us from another hotel. Galle Face have refused to accept any responsibility for this despite it going missing whilst in their care. We will pursuing this legally."
The British Raj at its absoloute best.
"It didn't bother us but seeing as a question about the beach appeared, you couldn't bathe, but it was no issue at all to us as the pool was magnificent"
"Location, historic building and staff"
Room description on booking.com differed to hotel website. We were moved after 2 days but made to feel as if we were complaining when we actually only wanted the suite we thought we had booked.
It’s got great character and the restaurant is very good with good variety of evening meals. Breakfast was ok. Staff are fantastic. Beds are very comfy. Great location to go walking and exploring. Plenty of tuktuks outside if you want to go anywhere.
It’s an old building so you can hear people moving around on the floor above which can wake you up. Room smelt a little musty or damp but nothing major. 
"Beautiful historic building. Wonderful dining. Buffet at breakfast was a great variety and huge buffet. English, Sri Lankan and to order eggs any style. Nice drink selection and pool. Wonderful place to recover during an extended journey. "
Our room was noisy from a wedding below us. (They moved us immediately no problem. Very service oriented). 
The staff were very kind to us when we arrived very early in the morning after a long flight and found us a room to occupy by mid morning at no extra cost.
Nothing at all.
"Loved the Long room for canapés and drinks in the evening. Breakfast was amazing. The staff could not have been more helpful. We had suites on the fourth floor overlooking the ocean, they were very quiet rooms."
Everything. It’s a lovely colonial style hotel. With seniority and elegance. The Cuban bar is great. I will definitely repeat if I go back to Colombo.
"Nothing, everything was great"
"We liked the Genius Loci of this place, the proffessional service, great breakfast, possition, the pool, lobby and the bar."
"We believe that the superior room we had needs refurbishing, it is quite worn out for a 5 star superior room"
Classic old colonial feel. Really nice bar/terrace area
Rooms are old fashioned - not necessarily a criticism but some people might want a more modern bathroom etc
"Friendly, courteous and helpful staff. Excellent choice of food in Verandah restaurant. Breakfast was superb and bar snacks were delicious.  Good choices for dinner.Room very comfortable and fresh fruit offered along with free non alcoholic drinks in fridge"
Nice grounds and beautiful old building.  In general staff extremely nice.  Buffet breakfast and lunch were very good.
"Booked connecting rooms 8 months in advance, upon arrival we were told the interconnecting rooms are small and unsuitable, ended up in two separate rooms and had to split our young children between rooms.  If they’d told me that 8 months in advance I would have cancelled the booking.  Ended up being a disaster of a two night stay and they didn’t seem to care at all.  Rooms are old and tired with archaic control systems.  Staff were nice but service was agonisingly slow even by Sri Lankan standards.  Terrible value for money compared to other hotels in the city, you’re paying for the history of the place more than anything else."
For historians a delight this old and famous hotel. Some of the rituals (such as an unusual ceremony every sunset) were very enjoyable.
"The rooms' bathroom needed some maintenance, but upon return to the hotel some days later all were very apologetic and a free upgrade was granted."
"The colonial charm of the hotel and its location overlooking the ocean, which was perfect for watching sunsets. Also, the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. A bonus was the quality and variety of food served at the buffets."
The room was a little small and there was a step up to get into the bathroom which could be a bit hazardous in the dead of night.
"Very comfortable as one expects with a 5* hotel of this stature. Lovely staff, quick & helpful at reception, excellent breakfast! Interesting to meet the gentleman doorman who has 52 years service with the hotel. "
"Some more sunshine would have been good to try out the pool, but nothing the hotel can control! 
"
I am a repeat customer.  I find this hotel ideal.
"The beds in the old wing can be a little small, and the bathroom has a window into the room, making light blocking difficult."
"Beautiful views, friendly waiting staff and great breakfasts. "
"Noise. Wooden floors and noisy people in the room upstairs meant I was woken at 1.15am on the first night and a party until 2.30am on the second night led to bad nights sleep. The spa was a bit disorganised and deep tissue massage was not deep tissue and not very good. 
Avoid if you want to sleep. I checked out a day early and management response was pretty poor. "
As hotels around the world slowly become indistinguishable from each other this hotel is unique full of surprises and as helpful and friendly as you can be. I loved it and I'm coming back.
"Beautiful building, furnishings and setting."
"The noise of people in the room above (wooden floors).The service from the hotels booking team, who rather than honour their advertised get three nights for two deal which wasn't working on their website, just removed it."
"The breakfast buffet is incredible. The walk from the room to the restaurant beside the beach is fantastic. Very relaxing atmosphere in the middle of busy city.We stayed here for our honeymoon and the special attention they brought to the presentation of the room was wonderful. Great service !"
"Beautiful colonial style hotel. Great wooden floors and historic fittings and furnishings.
Rooms are comfy with upmarket /old school feel. Pool is excellent with an amazing view of the ocean.
Location is great to get to some of the points of interest in Colombo.
Buffet breakfast has a great selection.
Also shout out to the pool bar staff who got us some buffalo curd and tikal even though it wasn't on the menu. "
Nothing really. Parts of the hotel exterior need a bit of TLC 
"This hotel truly lives up to its reputation as the finest hotel east of the suez. We checked in last minute, as an addition to our honeymoon travels and we were so glad we did! Amazing location, decor, staff, facilities and food. Would definitely recommend the Galle Face to anyone travelling in Sri Lanka."
"The building is fantastic. The hotel has really that classic stylish look.
Rooms are clean.
Breakfast is excellent."
"There is many staff around, however they’re not that focused on service and creating that special atmosphere. Eg waiting times for checking in and out are much too long.
The area around the hotel is dramatically changing.
Hotel is slightly overpriced for what you really get. It’s not that special experience I hoped to get."
"Staff were very friendly but not overly helpful. Swimming pool was amazing. The pool bar is also great for snacks and drinks almost any time of day. 
The building itself is just gorgeous. The galle face green is right next door and is a great spot to take in a sunset and sea breeze. 
The fort district is only a short walk and there is a shopping mall across the road. "
"The room wasn't as clean as it could have been. A pair of false eyelashes left in the shower were waiting for us the first time we used it. 
We called reception three times for assistance we never did receive. 
Price gouging when leaving. Don't ask for a taxi they will provide the hotel car for more than double the price of an actual taxi. Take an uber using the hotels Wi-Fi instead. "
"The whole hotel is an experience from beginning to end. Just walking around this beautiful hotel is like sight seeing in museum.  Their traditions such as the 6 oclock piper from the hotel to the shore, the two weddings we were lucky enough to watch.  All perfect.  Just one little problem.  The door between rooms (locked) did nothing to stop the noise next door.  We could hear teaspoons clinking, conversations, etc.  Luckily for us we had two considerate neighbours.  Not sure how that noise could be reduced.  Guess next time I would definitely ask for a room with no shared door.  However this is a beautiful hotel , on an amazing point of land in Colombo so make sure to go there (and ask for a room without door)"
Only the shared door probem
"We returned to this fabulous colonial oasis after 36 years and it was more wonderful than before. The hotel is charming and is a reminder of a bygone era.  The staff are very much up to date about the importance of friendly, efficient service and are able to communicate extremely well with travellers from all over the world. A smile goes a long way and there are certainly many of those from the hotel staff.  The restaurants, bar, pool, museum and grounds are top notch and make for a very romantic interlude in a very busy city.  My husband and I highly recommend The Galle Face Hotel."
Leaving
"The location, unique
The atmosphere, timeless
The hospitality, formal yet warm and unobtrusive
The seawater swimming pool
And now the spa..."
"Nothing, I am always satisfied with the best"
We were placed in an (upgraded) room above thumping music that kept us awake. 'Just till 11.30pm' we were told when we called reception. Appalling at these prices! We had to demand a change of room in the middle of the night - very inconvenient. Never again!
Well preserved colonial relic 
F&B staff at buffet area needs to be more proactive; the young trainees at Reception desk need better training and improve on their customer service attitude 
"almost everything was perfect. the beach front location. the heritage elegant property. the beautiful artefacts. the gorgeous beach front pool bar. the little private beach. the creative nooks & corners ... overall a dream stay ! would like to mention the team members Sampath at airport, Lalith & Sajid at the long room, manoranjan on floors, dannika at the verandah, Amila the front office supervisor & Malitha at reception & of course Mr Sadique.  So many others I dont have the names. they create awesome experiences for guests !"
"need more lights in the room and also light above the bathroom mirror. 
a lady at front desk called Nasheetha was quite rude & not helpful. "
"the hotel is the best place I have ever stayed at - the view from the room, the hoppers for breakfast and the sunset on the patio are incomparable - thanks"
"This is a fantastic hotel for a splurge. Yes, there are more affordable hotels in Colombo, but you need a night here to experience all the Dutch colonial charm. The staff were so accommodating, great rooms, amazing food and a wonderful experience."
This hotel is full of old world charm and the experience was fantastic.  The staff throughout and very helpful and pleasant.  Great location.  Would definitely recommend.
The room was a bit small.  We had an ocean view room with balcony but the cushions on the outside chairs were filled with rain water and there were no towels to use the outside lounges (though they soon arrived when requested).  The fridge did not work very well.
"The hotel was in a great location and had a lot of charm,  The staff were great - especially those who welcomed us on our arrival at 3am!"
Just outside the door to our room were all the spare beds/mattresses.  This was not a good look.
"Beautiful property which is built ON the beach, so you can hear the waves from almost everywhere in the hotel. So it gives you an unmatched resort vibe while still being located in the heart of Colombo city. They have preserved the grand heritage of the hotel very appropriately, we stayed in a 42 Sq.m junior suite with a huge private balcony facing the ocean. It doesn’t get better than that."
"The staff were a little lazy. People didn’t offer to help with luggage on both instances which was very surprising to me. The food also was acceptable but not a smack out of the park as one would have expected at a big 5 star in Colombo. Afternoon high tea at the veranda must be the most beautiful tea spot in Colombo. However the tea choices were disgraceful. Air conditioning in the room could have been a little more powerful, I suspect like most hotels they reduced the airflow between 2-5am."
What can one say about the Galleface Hotel that has not being previously said. This is an exceptional hotel and everything about it oozes five star. It should be on every traveller's itinerary to spend at least a couple of days at this hotel. We will be back.
Breakfast. 
"The room was very small and bathroom doors had problem. Not value for money. Had stayed here earlier, was given a better room. Not idle for old people and people on wheel chairs. "
Great spot great pool and nice bar and restaurant 
Not really value for the money you pay compared to other places. Concierge service not overly helpful
Balcony suite was wonderful & breakfasts excellent. Nanna wonderful breakfast manager
External paintwork was in a poor state especially front of building. Selection of drinks at happy hour in long bar was poor. If you are going to have a happy hour then make it a real happy hour otherwise I would have preferred to see the piping of the flag down at the main bar downstairs. Small front beach contained a lot of plastic litter that should be the responsibility of the pool attendant to clear every day. I picked up a lot but without a bin in sight all I could do was inappropriately give it to the breakfast bar attendant.
Wonderful old colonial charm to the hotel! Staff was friendly and accommodating and the food was delicious! They even surprised us with champagne in our room for our honeymoon!
The superior style rooms have very thin walls so you can hear everything in the next room.
The hotel staff were verry attentive. Great pool. The rooms very comfortable and the daily breakfast second to none. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.
"Stay at this hotel for a sense of grandeur and history. It feels a little like going back in time, in a good way. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite, which was about the size of a London flat, and very comfortable. Everything was polite and professional."
No complaints.
Excellent location. Spacious rooms. We were upgraded to junior suite. Had a seaview and view of pool deck. There is so much history and tradition at this hotel. The small museum is a must visit. There is also tours of the hotel on certain days. 
Nothing not to like. Staff at the Verandah restaurant were so helpful but we ate at pool restaurant one night and found the staff unhelpful. They need to up their game to match the other areas of the hotel.
"Great room with a view, we were upgraded and also had a cake waiting in our room as it was my birthday. This was a very kind touch which was much appreciated.good location to have a drink and watch the sunset as well.Beautifully preserved features in the hotel, classic compared to many of the more bland modern hotels nearby."
"There was an event taking place on the chequerboard/area in front of the bar/restaurant and by the beach the night we stayed. We were not informed of this in advance or when we checked in and you could hear everything through the windows as our room overlooked it. That would have been ok as it finished reasonably early but the crew then started  to dismantle all of the props and metal structures that were in place for it. They woke us around 12.30 with the noise from doing this as they took no care to do this quietly. They continued doing this until after 2.30 am (I don’t know when it stopped!) as I eventually fell asleep then (with ear plugs on!). I didn’t ring down as I kept thinking that surely the hotel staff would see and hear what was going on. Also, they obviously wanted them to dismantle it that night rather than next morning so I don’t think calling down would have made any difference as I doubt it would have been stopped just for us. It seems such an odd thing to do at that time of night in the first instance. If we had been informed in advance of this event, I would have asked for a different room.When we checked out, we weren’t asked how everything was but I did bring this up and the manager was called. They were very apologetic and offered an upgrade if we stayed again but couldn’t do that as we said we were leaving Colombo. They then gave us 2 bottles of water..It was a shame as it is a lovely hotel but due to being older, there is capacity for a lot of noise through the windows and under doors at night. I would perhaps return if I was in Colombo but not anywhere near the busier parts of the hotel and I do not think it is worth some of the rates that were quoted on booking.com (we got it last minute for c£100 which was ok). We stayed in Paradise Road Tintagel the 2 nights before and found it much more relaxing, calm and very professional staff."
"Nice colonial propertyRooms were very spacious and well maintained despite its age Lovely sunset view from the terrace and pool Complimentary minibar"
Nothing
The staff were most helpful and welcoming. The room was very well appointed and the views great. The breakfast sélection was good. 
The coffee was not good. 
"Beautiful colonial hotel; we stayed in a Junior Suite with an ocean view balcony, absolutely magnificent room. We ate in the 1864 restaurant and the meal was faultless. Thoroughly enjoyable 48 hour relax at the end of our holiday - we’ll be back one day. "
Faultless but a word of warning - we were able to book an airport taxi for £4K (local currency) less than the hotel service offered - look locally!
"Beautiful building with fabulous salt water swimming pool and views out to sea.Lovely room with view over the Green. Good breakfast."
I was asked on way out if I was checking out because I did not come from reception desk. It was not a pleasant ending
Location was good.
The staff were not very attentive. Very inconsistent with training as there seemed to be no standard. The staff did not wear their uniform with pride.  I choose the hotel based on its history and location. I expected the staff to be better. Hotel interior needs a good refurb. I would not recommend to others as there are many better close by.
"The range of restaurants and their beautiful settings. Loved the location on the waterfront. Magnificent pool. The staff were very helpful and attentive. Beautiful colonial building and peaceful atmosphere."
Nothing.
"Amazing old property refurbished right on the sea. Hotel has a great history and a museum inside.Great central location. You can spend hours in the coffeeshop looking at the sea!!!
Mine was a short stay so i cannot comment on the food but looked like a huge spread .Excellent staff. Very caring. I fell down outside the hotel and was hurt. Quick medication and manager himself came to see me and called few hours later to ask if i needed anything. Bellboy   smiled in greeting when he came to pick up my bags even   as early as  2.30 am  in the morning."
There was nothing not to like..
"We were upgraded, so possibly not the most objective review, but the hotel itself is just beautiful, with the colonial architecture preserved and accentuated. The staff we excellent and the food (we only had breakfast buffet) very good."
The pool is sea water. It's warm though.
The hotel has a great atmosphere - really takes you back in time. Also level of service is very high. Great romantic place for a couple
N/A - we had fantastic time
"The staff at the reception is very rude and non-professional. But I only had bad experience with one staff. Other staffs at the hotel is very helpful. The hotel is has easy access to supermarket, shopping center and beach. Jewelry store is worth to visit. The breakfast at the hotel is good."
"Customer service. The hotel is old,  needs renovation."
"the hotel is amazing and walking in its big rooms and corridors reacalls you all the past of the hotel and its prestige. The room was big, confortable and very clean. The mini frigo was included with a lot of local products that we enjoyed either for the taste and as well for promoting national products. The staff was really carefull and nice altought they had lot of work as the hotel was full of people. The swimming pool was very big and the sun beds very confortable. We did not used the restaurant as we thought it was a bit overpriced if you compare with other options in nearby first class hotels and in any case that night menu was with international food and we prefered a more local option. But still it was very good looking."
"Is a bit difficult to find something that was not as we expected. Of course the price is a bit high for being in Sri Lanka, but it is still cheap exspecially if you think back to your country where a luxury hotel would cost half of my salary per night. We also used the pick up service at the airport that  was kind and professional but I found out that many agencies provide it 40/45 % cheaper."
"This hotel is a true gem. A historic hotel with ample charm and character , all brought upto date for a modern stay. Although there are many luxury 5* hotels popping up near Galle Face I couldn’t imagine missing the opportunity to stay here."
The charm casts a spell that smooths over any cracks!
Gorgeous rooms. The pool by the ocean a lovely place to lounge on a hot day. Old world charm and a great central location. Treat yourself to a night here. 
Pricey but worth it. 
"Well located, comfortable,excellent staff,everything worked well from check in to check out,one of the best I have stayed in throughout the world"
Nothing 
"Visiting the museum within the hotel. The sense of history. The cocktails in the bar. The flag removal ceremony at sunset. The very comfortable bed
The upgrade to deluxe side sea view :) "
"No bath in bathroom 
The muesli "
"The Environment, The Location everything is top of the notch.
The staff! They were unbelievably helpful, polite & generous. Everything is beautiful & elegant. "
"They added extra 30% of tax on everything without mentioning it. Even on Booking.com.
After I guaranteed by credit card (Non-refundable) the hotel & Booking.com said the fare excluded 30% of extra tax.
Even the dinning menu or In room dining everything is charged with 30% extra without mentioning. This is frustrating. "
"The overall ambience, location of the property, staff courtesy , house keeping is of good quality.The hotel is a very old hotel , has good history and is very well kept. The staff is mix of young and senior employees who are very friendly and happy to assist any time."
There is nothing i can say i did not like.
"This hotel is an absolute gem, one of the best in Asia. The look is classy and has kept its old charm but modernised the experience. Amazing staff are accommodating and the view of the sea is fantastic."
Nothing!!
"Hotel very old and made of wood so there are a lot of insects. Breakfast is the same everyday (staying there for 5 days). Staff chatting very loudly in corridor, impolite when answering phone call, and purposely avoid opening door. There is no washroom door separating from bedroom so it's very cold when taking shower due to aircon from the other. Soundproof is very low (wall is not made by concrete - tested after knocking). In room dinning options is very limited. To make the matter worse, the food quality is very bad."
"a perfect hotel which takes you back in time  to the british colonial era.A beach facing hotel , old style building adds class.very helpful staff and comfortable stay,"
na
"The age, history and beauty of the place are clear. In its time and even today there is a certain opulence you don’t get with a modern hotel. The staff are all incredibly friendly and helpful. The room is tastefully appointed and the bathroom had a beautiful hot shower with plenty of space. The bar staff near the pool were exceptionally helpful and kind, also they make fantastic cocktails. Sitting ocean side in the evening while the waves crash against the ocean wall with the warm breeze is magic."
The room I was in had an ant infestation. I mentioned it to the staff who told me it was an old building. I think the language barrier may have been a problem but I had ants all through my bed. If I put food down for two minutes sure enough the ants would swarm the plate. This made me very uncomfortable the first night but I forgot about it the second and third. Due to the age of the building and wooden floors the wood creaks and groans. The large doors at the ends of the corridors bang loudly and I could hear people talking in rooms far down the corridor or coughing at night. These little things are nothing more than an annoyance but it does lend to the age and beauty of the building.
"Huge room, great bathroom & shower, and the breakfast/lounge/bar areas looking out onto the sea front are brilliant places to spend time any hour of the day.Particular favourite was bagpipes at the flag raising/lowering"
"Beautiful old hotel with a rich and interesting history which has bee very well refurbished.We loved looking out at the sea and it has a good pool area."
"The room was pokey ,too small with suitcases and only a place for 1 case. Our room was on the main Galle Face Road so rather noisy though it quietend down in the middle of the night.Please watch out for the local touts who pounced on us as soon as we left the hotel on foot claiming to be a member of staff and wanting to help us cross the road. We were exhausted and did not pick up on cues that we both felt we would have on a normal dayDo not use tuk tuks in Colombo just get the hotel to arrange a taxi.Maybe we just were unlucky but our day was expensive and unpleasant.....Happy to say we have met nothing but kindness since leaving Colombo!!"
The Galle Face is a hotel full of charm and old colonial style with period furnishings but up to date facilities. The staff were all so friendly and polite and we absolutely loved staying there and would love to stay again. Breakfast was probably the best one that we have ever had  - the buffet had everything that you could wish for! At sundown complimentary cocktails were served on the seafront with canapes and a 'Beating the Retreat' ceremony by the Sri Lankan pipes and drums - simply fantastic!
Nothing!
"The staff were lovely, particularly the reception staff. Friendly, helpful, warm. The setting is beautiful also, just if they could tidy up around the edges it would be even better again!"
"The hotel may be a heritage hotel, but that doesn't preclude good maintenance and regular updating of fittings! The food at the bar is also very bad, warmed up frozen food. Gym is embarrassingly small for this grade of hotel."
"Location, clean, good food, no pests, great laundry service"
The bathroom flooded every time the shower was used & everytime we got it dried it was never fully dry
"Beautiful, old fashion style hotel - like something out of a 1940's movie. Location makes it easy to move around Colombo. Can eat in the hotel at the restaurants close to the beach listening to the waves from the ocean crash into the sand/rocks."
"Room was tiny and lacked space for a business traveller (even with an upgrade). There was a fruit bowl and chocolates left in my room (nice gesture) but ants had attacked and this resulted in ants roaming around the room on the desk, in-and-out of my laptop. Condensation problems in this hotel means clothes hung in room do not dry, but rather seem to get more damp with moisture, even with air conditioning switched on. Wi-Fi was exceptionally poor in my room. Almost unusable so I just gave up which was frustrating as my stay was for business. Gym is nice but way too small and lacks modern day equipment e.g. only 2 treadmills meaning a wait time which is inconvenient."
"I always stay here in Columbo. I like the staff, the views of the Indian Ocean, the location and the furnishings, but most of all the beautiful building itself and the sense of colonial history. I also like the pool and pool area on the edge of the ocean and - sometimes- glorious sunsets."
Nothing that springs to mind.
"I like the atmosphere, location and the staff's of the sea breaz. 
Front desk staff's too are really good."
"There were lots of noise near the room, minor staff's were shouting and gossiping near the room. (Cleaning Staff's)
Management issued us a letter saying that certain things are complimentary and on discount, but restaurant staff's are not aware about it. 
Person who came to check the mini bar was really rude, he ask the reason in delay in opening our room door.
Linen were too old, look faded.
"
Such history!  The interiors are incredible.  Location is perfect.
"Im not a fan of Buffet style eating, otherwise this hotel is amazing.  There is another fancier restaurant though to dine at.  Despite that, I would still stay at this hotel again."
"Old world charm with modern elegance.  Staff were helpful, friendly and were more than happy to assist you in any way. Emanuel, the concierge, was passionate about the manner in which he approached his job. His assistance was invaluable."
"The Galle Face was terrific... Its position and history and old world charm. The rooms were massive, I'm sure we were upgraded to a suite - we had the best balcony (and I will miss the resident crow!)"
One badly booked meal (fish) on one occasion at the pool bar.
The breakfast was very good and the buffet dinner excellent.Not enough choice during lunch.The staff were extremely helpful to arrange all the needs
"The first room we were given as an upgrade  was not in good decorative order and had a big bathtub in the middle of the room, which means it is not an upgrade in the old wing which needs to be reburshed."
The colonial style building and central location 
Our 3 teenage kids arrived into Colombo at midnight. It was 2am before they arrived to the hotel. Although we had already checked them in there was no bedding or towels for the 3rd person. I think a bit more attention to detail is important 
Location
"Went with the family. We got overcharged by the hotel. Staff and managers are horrible and they try to trick you once u check in and offer a free upgrade but then u realise that it was not free. Food is really bad. Rooms wr full of insects and ants, but they changed our room. Carpets inside the room are too old and stinky. And all that was fr 300$ per day. Never again."
The Galle Face Hotel is a colonial heritage masterpiece filled with all manner of colonial charm and ambience.  The 30m salt water pool was wonderful as I like to swim 2kms every day.
The cost of the driver from airport to hotel was very expensive.  The people that assist with external excursions didn't appear to be all that keen or willing to make much of an effort to provide assistance.
"Lovely Colonial hotel, great setting overlooking the ocean, a number of nice bars/restaurants in the hotel and friendly staff. Room was spacious and clean."
"The room was very comfortable for our first night in Sri Lanka. The hotel is beautiful, colonial style, with lots of 'hidden' gems (we stumbled across a museum storing Prince Philip's first car!). Service was excellent both at check in/out and in the seafood restaurant. Food was amazing too, very fresh and reasonably priced. Pool was clean and pool staff friendly/helpful in bringing towels, mats and drinks. Highly recommend if you have a night or two in Colombo."
Nice outlook
"The crows that flew around the property and into the restaurant, staff could have made a better effort to reduce their interaction with guest experience."
The fudge on arrival! Big pool and a lovely choppy sea view.
"Front desk staff - ignored us when we first arrived and then didn’t feel the need to say we’d left sunglasses on the counter when we checked out. We were in a tuktuk before we realised and came back and the glasses were still sat there. There’s so many staff in the reception. Also the man managing the pool literally pulled sunbed mats from under people at the mere flicker of rain. They got wet when people swam so a little OTT."
I read a few reviews saying this place was a bit tired and shabby. That must have been before a makeover because it's stunning now. The spa is the best quality that you would find in London and the rooms are really beautiful. Great food and cocktails and not particularly expensive. The room is significantly more expensive than most places in Colombo but it's definitely worth it. You won't find this kind of old glamour anywhere else.
"We checked out a lot of Colonial Hotels during our Sri Lankan holiday and this one tops them all. Staff were so friendly and accommodating, my room had a lovely view of the sea, huge bath, the outdoor salt water pool was fabulous, and they even have bagpipes playing to take down the flag at dusk. Don’t miss the chance to stay, absolutely a holiday highlight!"
Service tax not included and not really clear until the bill comes. Otherwise no issues at all!
"The hotel is gorgeous, especially the newly renovated rooms. The second floor has amazing large balconies, great for evening drinks. The restaurants were also very good. All the staff were amazingly helpful and lovely, responding positively for all our requests. will be certainly staying there again on my next visit to Colombo."
"Room service can be a tiny bit slow sometimes. But if you're one a balcony enjoying the view, it doesn't matter much."
"As described, the atmosphere and the breath of history is really impressive. The staff, especially at reception really friendly, helpful and very polite, top 👍"
"I really cannot say, what I disliked. It is an amazing, huge hotel, where you can breathe history, kind of hotels, I usually like more, then these super modern hotels. Staff, especially at reception was extremely friendly and helpful, sure top class. But leaving the hotel, there was missing this wow effect, wanting to stay another night."
"Wished we had stayed longer to fully experience what the hotel had to offer. The building itself, and the staff were amazing. Bed SO comfy! Sadly we didn't get to have breakfast :("
That we weren't there long enough!
"Location is excelllent, rooms are clean and nice "
"Staff was impolite, room allocation was horrible, with two infants they made me change 3 rooms before the room that i had booked was alloted, happy hours manger was very rude and bad behaviour."
"This place is an absolute gem and completely worth the money - it will really make your stay in Colombo very special. From the beautiful rooms, variety of restaurants and gorgeous pool, this was an excellent hotel. I highly recommend it."
I had my wedding ceremony at the hotel and they went out of their way to make sure that the weather didn't dent our celebrations! excellent customer service and very friendly staff. The oldest/prestigious hotel in Sri Lanka gave the best service which is on par with the industry.
"If you like the movie Casablanca you will love the famous Galle Face hotel. The staff, service, and food are delightfully elegant in an old world way. The building and grounds are magnificent. We enjoyed the spa which is well run and clean. The food is one half English style and half Indian-Sri Lankan. The outdoor restaurant is sooo pleasant. The room was airy and spacious. Complimentary snacks and fantastic room service. Loved the experience."
We’re sorry we had to leave.
Beautiful colonial style hotel great location... We were there on a Buddhist holiday w/e with wonderful festivities and lights around the city but no alcohol served anywhere when we were dying for a G and T by The Indian Ocean at sunset .. Which is why you stay at Galle Face!
"The GFH was stunning in every aspect, the food, rooms, pool. There is such a grand old-world feeling to this hotel. We loved everything about our stay."
Staff were really friendly and helpful. We got a tour booked for Sigiriya and Dambulla and it was really nice organized.
"This hotel is not worth the money. It is really expensive for what you actually get. The room is not that big, it has just a tiny window facing some houses roofs. It was really humid, all the clothes in the bag got wet due to the humidity and the beds felt like they were wet as well. Tv quality on the room was really poor, double image, pixeled... the shower wasn’t great either. Really close to the wall which will make all the water get out of the bathtub while you shower. The room controls (lights) were like 30 year old. Overall experience wasn’t great. Considering the amount of money we paid, we’re not happy with the results."
"We only stayed overnight after flying in to Colombo.The hotel was well kept overall.The staff were friendly and attentive. The room was a good size as was the bathroom. We had a nice view of the bay.The breakfast was substantial."
The bathroom had a fair few cracks and could've been a bit cleaner.
View was divine .. room great service excellent .. we loved the buffet and Seaspray restaurant.. we will look forward to coming back soon and wish we could have stayed longer
"Beautiful traditionsl historic hotel, so much Old Ceylon charm! Great bed pillows. Nice staff.loved the museum and the Travellers bar."
"The restaurants charge a fortune..we went to the seafood restaurant expecting top seafood, we had a cold shared seafood dish -  but it was tasteless and small quantity, service was poor had to ask several times for the waiter to come over...we were really disapointed.  Bed was also uncomfortable but pillows were great."
I was only like the location
"In the name of Gall Face I thought its one of the best place to stay in Sri Lanka, Finally I have realized that I have made the wrong choice. I would not recommend to anyone this hotel anymore and I will never go there again.I was there with my family for a short stay and I was totally disappointed about the food and the services that we were received, I paid about AUD500 Per day, but its not worth what I paid.Specially, there's nothing to eat in the buffet, most of them are empty, also, labels are  incorrect,  there are many issues which I could not wright here. And it's not good for the star hotel like this. hence its effect to the reputation of the hotel and to the Country.Thanks"
"The view was great to enjoy your breakfast on the veranda. The food and service at breakfast was wonderful. Meal in the fine dining restaurant was just perfect. Staff very friendly, informative and helpful."
"Difficult to get to room on 4 floor, very confusing. Very dark in  bathroom to get ready, no natural light. Room on road side so a little noisy. Air con only effective if on high all night.Hit and miss depending on the room you get i think!"
"Beautiful rooms with view on the sea 
Incredible location and amazing atmosphere 
Got upgraded to an amazing suite "
"Slow wifi 
Bad reception on the tv "
"Excellent breakfast, gorgeous views from the terrace. The pool was lovely. Generally the hotel is an oasis of tranquillity to escape noisy Colombo!"
Room had a slight drain smell.
Amazing location...couldn’t ask for anything better. 
Food variety could be improved. If they don’t have enough occupancy they don’t serve buffet breakfast or dinner.
This hotel has the best position in Colombo with a wonderful seawater pool right on the beach.  It has been sympathetically renovated with very comfortable rooms but still retains a nostalgic grandeur.
"This was our second stay at Galle Face Hotel. It's full of old-world charm, the service is excellent, and the food at 1864 is delicious. The spa is far better than it was two years ago. Overall, a great experience. We'll definitely stay here again."
"The breakfast could've been better. While some items were very good, others were rather bad. It's a bit of a hit and miss."
Staff were fantastic helpful and friendly. The breakfast and themed dinner buffet was excellent. The spa was amazing. I would recommend this hotel to others.
"Location and people Good , Breakfast Excellent and Chef was so co operative to support for Pure Veg Food and Guided us."
"Carpet very dirty , In Room too much ants .Though they know I am handicapped having walking problem they provided room is south block which far away from lobby and breakfast area"
The location was great and the building beautiful
"I was told that I would have a sea view but was put in the back by the linen storage cupboard!  Food in the bar was truely terrible - samosas that were cold and rubbery and also a club sandwich made with stale dry bread.   Overall a disappointment. Some style but very little substance."
"Location is great. Hotel is iconic and well preserved.Nice museum."
"There is no beach.Very small pool.Crowd invade the dinning area near the pool once food is served. N Ed’s to be addressed by management."
"Always a great place to stay in Colombo had a sea view room , breakfast was very good and as ALWYS the staff super helpful and friendly"
Towels in room a little worn and no complimentary water at the pool as in previous visits
"This is a beautiful historic hotel that has some amazing features to it. We loved the museum and the restaurant, we also sat out at the seaside bar and had a late coffee, it was a wonderful location. "
"Amazing location, very nice hotel. The buffet was one of the best I’ve tried with an excellent price and variety. The hotel is well maintained. The staff are friendly, I had a problem with the WiFi and they took care of it in a few mins. Excellent place to stay. I asked them for a cake for a celebration and they had it in the room right on time. I definitely recommend it. "
"We returned to this hotel to recapture a treasured memory after having our first meal in Colombo there when we honeymooned in Sri Lanka 6 years ago.They kindly gave us a room with a sea view.  It is a grand old hotel and the buffets are to die for. We had breakfast both days. The swimming pool overlooking the ocean is great. The staff were very friendly and accommodating."
"The rooms are in need of a bit of TLC. Although we love the authentic vintage of this hotel, a little bit of sprucing up in the bedroom and bathroom would make a world of difference. It is expensive to stay here and the cost of food and drinks matches this.  We knew that when we booked so that’s ok."
"The food in the restaurant was excellent and there was a good choice. The saltwater pool was large and deep, and warm!"
"The room was not in good condition - it felt tired and some maintenance was needed on the towel rack in the bathroom. The smell from the drains was very noticeable.  More significantly, and what really ruins the hotel, is that the staff attitude to guests was poor, with an air of self-importance which shouldn’t be present in such an expensive establishment.  The staff on the pool bar were lax and more interested in chatting with each other than serving. Very disappointing."
"Loved the property - beds were very comfortable, rooms were clean, staff very friendly and knowledgeable, enjoyed the 'club' room, salt water pool was nice. Would definitely recommend this to others - especially if they like historical things - restoration is beautiful."
Have no complaints.
Beautiful building and classic location. The wedding receptions are pageants.
"Synthetic - or, at least, blends - towels in the bathroom - which did not absorb water - and synthetic serviettes in the restaurant. Resupply of the room was a bit erratic. Food was okay, but not great."
Great location and really nice staff and wonderful ambience!
Could have been more chairs in the room. Only one. Or other places to put clothes. Bad towels.
"Wow, from the moment you walk into Galle Face Hotel you know that you are in for a good stay. An incredible old building in immaculate condition with friendly staff and great facilities."
"Helpfulness if staff. Celebration day on 15/4 was lots of fun with drummers, dances & games. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Chef Brian was cheerful & happy to explain all about Sri Lankan foods."
Making a mistake - my partner & I both accidentally made a booking each. The hotel upgraded 🤗us one night at our request but no cancellation ☹️
"Owners did a great job of maintaining the history and heritage of the property, while also providing modern comfort. There are small niggles (minor fit and finish issues, leisurely response to some requests) - but would recommend to take it as part of the charm. The gentleman hired to scare off crows with a slingshot outside the breakfast place is a remarkable anachronism."
"Request to set up an extra bed took half an hour and a reminder before it got done. There were minor imperfections in the room (slightly askew hole covering the ceiling, rattling bathroom fittings)."
"To be honest: We read a lot about it and were a bit sceptical but the Galle Face hotel surpassed our expectations!
Beautiful wooden floors, breathing history in every corner, very friendly and helpful staff, located right by the Indian Ocean, amazing breakfast, clean and well air conditioned rooms, very nice and long saltwater outdoor pool!
Like we said in the title: A perfect place to stay your first few days when you arrive in Sri Lanka"
Only negative point is that from the hotel you have to look at the Harbour being build opposite the hotel ruining your view!
"Excellent staff; the breakfasts were lovely and the rooms extremely comfortable and well appointed. The pool was fantastic and loved the location at the far end of the Galle Face Green. Made for a pleasant stroll into the Fort area. I had trouble checking in for flights on my mobile and was able to use their business centre to do so and print my boarding passes. The common areas are also very beautiful, you can really feel the history in the hotel without it being run down. Room service was excellent in quality and delivery."
"My experience in the spa was horrible (that being said, my sisters was fantastic and they did offer me 15% off my service based on the feedback they asked for right after the treatment, even though I didn't ask for any compensation). I found the buffet dinners at the Verandah the two nights we went (Japanese and Indian) to be OK but overpriced for what they were. Unless you are a big eater, I would go with a la carte."
The staff were extremely helpful. I liked the free minibar despite no alcohol in it. I loved the building the history and the museum. It had some great pictures throughout the hotel. It was a great last hotel of our holiday. We were treated very well.
View of the docks and ufgly buildings that now surround it.
Location & ambience
"Financial discipline. I was charged double for my room. A pre authentication of $ 250 was excess charged to my credit card instead of cancellation of the pre authentication.This is unexpected for a booking through Booking.com. We will lose confidence on the site if this continues."
Local Sri Lankan food at Dinner and Breakfast was excellent.
"Unfortunately not the best place for a woman travelling alone. Before 8 am in the morning, a male staff member unlocked and entered my room while I was in the bathroom. After I spoke out, he quickly backtracked and I confronted him in the hallway outside to query his presence in my room. His excuse was to do my laundry, which had not been requested, and why would that require room entry anyway? Next, during breakfast in the Ladies Washroom downstairs of the bar area, a male staff member stood grinning in the doorway as I came out of a cubicle to follow me (dressed modestly in long sleeves and long skirt) to the stairs making suggestive remarks. Although the Hotel Manager expressed concern about the incidents, sadly I will not consider to stay again alone in this place."
"This is the only place to stay in Colombo. Directly on the beach in an iconic area. The hotel has had a magnificent make over. Old world charm overlain with everything that you would expect from a 5* hotel nowadays. Lovely wooden floors and large, well equipped spacious rooms. The hotel staff were lovely and very helpful. The food was excellent and the most amazing breakfast. The salt water swimming pool was a treat and watching the sunset in the grounds and the piper piping down the flag at the same time was a treat."
Nothing
"Lovely old hotel with lots of charm. I would stay here again for a day or two en route somewhere else in Sri Lanka, as this is (in my view) a transit hotel not a holiday location due to no beach. Ask for room 2044!"
Reception and check-in staff. Delayed our check-in by 30 mins and tried to put us in a room that was lower than the standard we had paid for. This started our stay with a bad feeling about the hotel. Staff are good but could be better.
The breakfast was the best I had in Sri Lanka. Nice big room.
Very expensive. For this price they should include an airport shuttle at least. Also the hotel taxi driver overcharged me for a very short journey. Avoid them and use the tuk tuks.
"This a great old colonial property, essentially modernized, with a convenient setting in the center of the city.  The facilities were beautiful and well-maintained.  We stayed in the premier balcony rooms and enjoyed a spectacular view, a comfortable room, and access to an open-bar happy hour."
"This is not a perfect 5 star top-class hotel; the staff can be a little erratic, and the rooms have some wildlife and history despite their refits.  If you expect 5+ star perfection, this may not not for you, but if you have a little patience and enjoy some quirk with your heritage, it's a wonderful place."
The breakfast buffet is fabulous and the attention to detail by the front office staff and concierge is wonderful.
"The service in the Traveller's Bar was chaotic. wrong drinks delivered, drinks missing.  Needs attention."
"Loved it. We got a good rate so perhaps not the best room so we didn’t have a balcony (which is hard with young kids) but hat was our mistake! Museum, library and pool all great facilities. Also absolutely loved the fine dining restaurant bar"
Location and hotel are amazing. Graceful colonial building in original style. Hotel is adjacent to Gale Green and walking distance to Dutch hospital shopping area. On site food is good and reasonably priced.
"Service is hit and miss. To give an example (could give more) ordering a cab at the reception was a painful undertaking where I was sent by reception, to concierge, to an empty taxi stand to a porter who sent me back to reception where I was asked to call myself. Typically upmarket hotels can’t arrange a taxi for their guest. Not here (unless you take the overpriced hotel taxi)."
"The hotel has been beautifully brought up to date keeping the gentle ambience and features of the old hotel, combined with the comforts of modern living. Everything you need and more. Staff were efficient and very friendly - nothing was too much trouble. "
The only thing wrong was that we didn’t stay long enough. 
"Fantastic historical hotel, renovated not too long ago. Beautiful building with very nice historical details. Great service and very good restaurant. The bar outside is amazing with sea view. Favorite hotel in Colombo"
Beautiful heritage building near the ocean
"Small room. Poor wifi which kept getting disconnected, mould in the bathroom edges, air conditioning died in the middle of the night. wake up call late by 30minutes!"
My wife and I were treated like royalty!  Every detail was properly taken care of with excellence.
"I see my settings on Booking.com must be wrong.  I am an American, but this review states that I an Sri Lankan!  Never mind who I am, the stay was exceptional."
The hotel is run with efficiency and professionalism geared towards the comfort of guests.  The rooms are spacious and well-serviced and the staff strike the right balance between attentiveness and respect for your personal space.
The menu at the restaurant would benefit from the inclusion of more sophisticated dishes in both Sri Lankan and European cuisine.
The staff were wonderful in particular Kumar who looked after us in the long room. The swimming pool was well run and staff were accommodating in trying to find you a space at busy times. The gym although small did the job and the personal trainer there was a gentlemen. House keeping staff were friendly and accommodating also. Overall I was very impressed and I would definitely stay here again.
I didn’t dislike anything
"Beautiful and recently refurbished hotel. Excellent location, food and good service. One of a kind really. "
"Arrogant and condescending front desk staff. Extremely unhelpful during check in and reluctant to give a warm welcome. When asked to extend stay they said this was only possible at a fee of 380 USD which is a shame as later that day we got notifications of booking.com offering rooms at 100 USD. This really gave a negative twist to our overall stay.
The fact you cannot pull up in a tuk tuk is ridiculous. This is Sri Lanka and not Monaco - please get a grip. 
With the ongoing real estate project on the west side of the hotel the view will soon be that of any major city and thus be ruined. I think the atmosphere the hotel boasts will be totally gone as Colombo is getting to ready to be the next Dubai."
The hotel has a wonderful history and is located very well.
"The windows on the side of our room were filthy. The blinds were pulled down on that side and the cleaners ignored the windows behind, like for years. The bath was also not clean and when you turned on the jets, loads of black gunk came out. The staff were generally quite snooty and were not overly keen to provide good service.In general the hotel is a little tired and very over priced."
"Staff was very friendly and prompt supporting (especially Mr.Manoj). I travel once a yr to Colombo for biz, this is the 1st time to Galle Face and for me it has the best compromise quality/price."
"The hotel has a rustic feel to it, it has character, and at the same time provides all the modern facilities. Right on the sea, views are great."
"service in the restaurant was not always efficient, waiting to be serviced"
"We always stay there. Everything works, the food id great, the position unrivalled, and you can't beat the retro-Imperial chic of the Real Thing. Also, the gym's been fixed with new kit."
Nothing
"Beachfront, colonial charm."
"Surly staff, the only hotel we stayed at where the welcome was indifferent. When the power failed 0630 as we were leaving, we dressed in the dark and were unable to use hairdryer, manager said it was my fault for not having reported it, despite it being quite inappropriate for a workman to be in our ( 2 females ) room as we were dressing and packing for an early airport departure. no apology. Poor service, no hand towels or dryers in the hotel loos."
"For our final stop in Sri Lanka we chose to stay in a nice room in a nice hotel and picked the Galle Face Hotel.  We had a junior suite with a private balcony and lovely spa bathtub.  It came with breakfast and free happy hour drinks (which we sadly couldn't take as much advantage of as we would have liked).  Not a cheap place to stay, but very luxurious and would have been nice to stay another night or two.  We were delighted to find the hotel had a library - and amused to discover the museum.  It is a charming colonial hotel and the most formal place we stayed at in Sri Lanka."
Many coastal places have seagulls - Galle Face Hotel has crows and they will steal the food off your plate if you're not careful!  They also went after my hair a couple of times.  One of the restaurants has someone employed to shoo them off with a laser pointer which was somewhat effective.  Occasionally the air conditioning was a little fierce.
"Was a lovely stay the staff were lovely particularly Shiraz on reception he was very very helpfulLooking forward to returning again soon. Bedroom was lovely, excellent shower and very comfy beds.  The breakfast choice was exceptional"
We liked everything
Location is by far the best among all other hotels in Colombo.
"Interior of the room is old could have been updated.  I am sure there are better rooms at higher prices.  However, there are far better and newer hotels with better services are available at better prices.  This hotel is betting on the past fame than the actual current state of the hotel."
Watching the sunset from the bar and the piper piping down the flag is very moving.  Hotel has teal style.  Great free mini barwell stocked.  Comfy bed very relaxing
"The Agatha Christie atmosphere, location, food, staff come from another world, unfortunately passed away..."
"Who cares ?...you don't want it to be perfect.."
"I stayed at GF twice. The first time I was lucky to be upgraded to a suite, where i was lulled to sleep to the sound of crashing waves.  The second time was in a beautiful room too.  I enjoyed leisurely buffet breakfasts......so many choices. thank you."
Another very enjoyable stay at the GF. Love the old world charm and the packed breakfast box kept us going on an early long railway trip. Very thoughtful.
Nothing. Staff used to be a bit offhand but no longer all were really helpful. A good couple of night's stay.
"Great location, property beautifully restored"
Rooms are small and service is extremely slow in the restaurant. My sorbet came to me in a slopping mess after having had to wait nearly half hour for it.
Great setting and heritage.
Our room had no view. So check before booking. The car service based in the hotel turned out to be by far the most expensive we used while in Sri Lanka.
"We stayed at the GF on the first night of our trip to Sri Lanka and loved it so much that we decided to stay on our last night as well. Perfect welcome from staff, who were kind enough to upgrade us so that we could be closer to the pool, a cuddly toy for our new baby, beautiful room with Jacuzzi bath, delicious dinner and breakfast. Can't recommend highly enough."
"I have never been so inspired by anywhere quite like the Galle Face Hotel.It’s rich in history, incredible art works, the hotel decor is so classic, yet warm and inviting. It uses a range of textures, fabrics, woods and colours. The people who make the Galle Face so inviting with their warm smiles.The day spa was exceptional.Highly recommend."
Old colonial building
"I was arriving early morning. To make sure that I do not encounter answer like: check in time is after 2 my room was paid from day before... well it was not ready! Of course I protested and made sure they read the reservation again. It took over an hour to clarify that. Honestly it should not happen. Then I was given far inferior room with dirty windows overlooking parking, for a short period. I moved to my room early afternoon. They should take off one night from my bill at least for that kind of service!!!! NO, they did not! So not such a great experience. I could stay in Shangrila just across where I have high status, I loved the look of the Galle Face..."
"Bathroom is good, great water pressure. Great food and dining. Beds great. It’s a lovely hotel."
We had to move a lot as we wanted and paid for 2 rooms which were not provided.. took a while to get the correct rooms.
"We had a spacious comfortable room. The restaurant on the verandah serves varied buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner. At sunset, the flag is lowered by an official accompanied by a bagpipe player in kilt. Good salt-water pool."
"We really loved our stay, in particular the decor and the ambience! Perfect location as well!! The breakfast was simply delicious! Very nice also the entrance and the first floor common areas!! Relaxing and fully of charme!"
"The room was quite small, but this was part of the charme and we do not see it as a negative point! We would definitely come back!"
"Large room and bathroom,very clean.No terras but the window can be opened. Staff very friendly. Beautiful spa, not cheap."
Swimming pool is with salt water.
"I knew this was a hotel with a reputation but I genuinely didn't expect to be as blown away by it as I was. Gorgeous, grand place. We tried the seafood restaurant and it was lovely. A holy day so no alcohol design at the bar but still a glorious place. If you have the ability walk up and down the stairs rather than use the lifts. Even the atrium areas are amazing!"
Nothing!
The communal rooms were great...fantastic old colonial feel. Our room had a great view.
The lighting was rather dim and the towels etc in the bathroom in short supply...
Overrated.  A very old hotel that does a poor job with soundproofing. Woke up when someone above my room started his morning prayers with a loud speaker.
The room is very comfortable and the complementary mini bar facility we enjoyed. Breakfast had a vast spread of food and delicious. Hotel staff is friendly and supportive.
The pool has no shallow end so a person who can't swim better can't enjoy the salt water pool. No view from the room.
"Great location and the service was friendly if slightly slow. My big comment was that we ate at 3 restaurants, the Verandah, the Sea Spray and 1864. The Verandah and Sea Spray were excellent, see below for the 1864."
"1864 was poor actually. Service was fine although it took an age for the wine to arrive as they had to get it from Sea Spray, but the food was far too western in a country with so much wonderful food. It was also empty on a Saturday night probably because of that."
Lovely room (in spite of being street-side (still not too noisy). Excellent fish restaurant (Sea Spray) looking over Indian Ocean) British Raj-type architecture  in wonderful setting.
"Staff (especially at buffet restaurant in evening) slow and lacked a welcoming smile (otherwise the key feature of Sri Lankan hospitality). Had problems and delays with correct billing for what we ate (nobody explained the computer was down!) ...not the best experience in our jetlagged state, so sadly we were left feeling the ""raj experience"" was a bit wanting."
"The room (2044) was big and comfortable. It included breakfast and evening drinks + canapés in the Long Room; very quiet with personal service. Food was excellent. The hotel itself is a classic example of British colonial architecture, a welcome change from the usual 5-star places."
Pool a bit small; limited space which could get crowded.
"A lovely old colonial building, directly on the ocean.We loved sitting in the garden, watching the sunset.Food was excellent and very tasty, the SPA area a bit too coldbut worth a visit. Go and see the little museum."
"A horrible construction zone is spoiling the view. Investors are building an island  right infront of Galle Face, call it Harbour city, with skyscrapers, Dubai style for many people. It is very very sad and will destroy the charme of the whole area."
"Really excellent service, fantastic breakfast!"
"Not the hotel’s fault...I feel sad  that there is a huge construction project underway, north of Galle Face Green. It doesn’t spoil the sunset view and some people who love building things will be fascinated, but it is constrast with this lovely hotel!"
"The hotel is very classic - colonial style but the rooms are well furnished and modern. We received a free upgrade to a suite, which was fantastic. The breakfast buffet has a nice spread of Western and local fare."
Milk Toffee on Arrival was a very nice touch.  The in house museum and library gave a great sense of history of the hotel along with the painting and photographs of the hotel in its past glory.  The Breakfast buffet was amazing.  The Lo'ocitane spa was fabulous!  In particular the  grounds facing west are a great spot for a drink whilst watching the sun go down.
"On check in we were told our room would be affected by noise.  when we requested to be relocated they were quite reluctant to do so, but in the end accommodated our request.  A very minor blemish on what was a great stay."
Colonial style. Location - listening to the waves break enjoying a drink/dinner. Excellent level of service. Sea Spray restaurant - great venue and great food.
Hotel can feel a bit tired - but it is part of its colonial charm and heritage.
"The room was perfect, with an amazing view to the sea and sunset, a very comfortable bed, and a lovely bathroom. The swimming pool is beautiful - cool salt water."
"It was wonderful to live in a museum for 2 days. It looks amazing in the lobby, restaurants, library,  and the museum."
"Unfortunately our room (4006) was a disappointment, the light was very unpleasant, the bathroom needs an urgent renovation (smells like mold), and the towels are grey instead of white."
It's not like a modern 5 star but it is well compensated by its caracter. Good breakfast but average coffe. High tea was excellent.
Not enough sun chairs at the pool. Only one hanger for bath towels is a bit annoying.
Fabulous and personalized attention. The hotel has a lovely view of the Indian Ocean with really nice sunsers. In the restaurant  they serve a buffet with different types of food every day. Always delicious.
I liked everything.
"Great location with stunning views, and nice food. "
"2 small things: Limited activities - which suited us, to be fair - and there were a lot of staff just sort of loitering around, which was mildly off-putting. 
"
Beautiful colonial building with wonderful sea views. Staff very friendly and the 1864 hotel restaurant was fantastic - best steak we've had in months.
The service could be very slow at times and the little touches you expect from a five star hotel were missing.
"This is simply a great hotel. It is old - 1860s -  but beautifully renovated. It is right on the ocean front and a 15-20 walk to the Fort area of Colombo. The seafood restaurant is superb. Great service, large comfortable and clean rooms, excellent public area inside and outside. Why stay in other hotels that cost as much or more when you get such character at the Galle Face."
Nothing.
The atmosphere is lovely and it was a pleasure to stay in such a historic building.
"I had a couple of water problems in my bathroom which were rectified; the front desk staff were a) slow checking me in b) weren't great at recommending how to get to places, so do your own research. c) I stayed in one of their basic rooms which was frankly average so upgrade yourself I'm sure there are nicer rooms"
Our bed was comfy and we had an excellent dinner in the Sea Spray restaurant.
It took over an hour for us to be checked in and there was no explanation from the staff about how to use the bedroom control centre. the WIFI was not very fast.
An excellent start to our holiday and a nice gentle introduction to Sri Lanka the staff were helpful and friendly.
A room with a view our room faced out onto the noisy street and road below.
"Galle Face Hotel is an institution in Colombo, for its heritage, service and location. I remember in from when I first stayed there 40 years ago. It has now been restored and the history and service maintained. Highly recommended!"
You pay for the experience. The price is prohibitive for some.
I had read about the Galle Face Hotel in a fictional book about the 1920's and have wanted to go there for a while.  Entrance lobby very welcoming and grand.  The staff were both friendly and very efficient.  Still had that air of colonial grandness even though has recently been renovated.
It is a real shame that such a beautiful and iconic hotel is soon to be surrounded by ugly tower blocks being built and the view to the West of the hotel and swimming pool is right in the line of huge building works being carried out for the new port.  Very soon Colombo will look like all the other big skyscraper cities in the world losing the charm.  The only thing I think could have helped is double glazing on the windows as you can hear the traffic as still single glazed.
Location. Good value for money.
"Hidden costs. False advertising from Booking.comHidden charges. VAT, Breakfasts, etc.Inflexible in room requests. Guests had to share beds or have fold up beds.In practical room check in & check out"
"Phenomenal view, amazing breakfast buffet, multiple bars and restaurants to choose from and an amazing pool. The building is 150 years old and has a long history of visiting writers, poets, politicians and other figures. The evening I arrived the Prime Minister of Singapore was dining in the higher-end restaurant - quite impressive! The property, pool, view, staff - everything exceeded my expectations. I was travelling alone on a stop before heading south and found the property very welcoming for a single traveler. I stayed in the ""old wing"" with a view of the courtyard and ocean and have to say of the 65+ countries I have traveled to this property makes the top ten!"
"The tub in the bathroom (in the old wing) wouldn't drain very well so there was standing water while showering. The room itself is old but that is part of its charm. Also, there is not much to do in Colombo but that is not the fault of the hotel."
Almond croissant excellent and very wide choice
Very small  point but would be good to allow Tuk Tuk to drop guests at reception rather than outside on the roadside
"Good old colonial style. Lots of famous people stayed here in the past. You feel like in Ritz or Claridges, but in the middle of dirty Colombo.Nice little beach, beautiful bars and restaurants.Food at dinner and breakfast was good. Taxi to airport 3100 rupee (45 min on the high way)WiFi is good( usually not in the other hotels)"
Check in and check out could be quicker.
"Hotel helped us with a very early Check-In and Upgrade and in general staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was great - nothing missing and great view. We enjoyed the pool - wonderful view and good water. Beautiful setting, wonderful hotel and very good pricing."
Being right at the seaside is so beautiful. Breakfast is fantastic. Being in this hotel with its history is a great experience.
"We had a room without a view (onto a adjacent building) which considering the price was a bit disappointing. Not very soundproof, probably given the age of the building. We could hear everything on the TV of the room next door and all conversations in the hallway."
"Old Colonial style of the hotel. Well maintained generally however sometimes lacked attention to detail.Good location for sightseeing.Staff were very polite and helpful but sometimes service was slow."
location is excellent
"housekeeping was very disappointing for a hotel this pricey. rooms were often not cleaned well enough. property , especially rooms not well maintained and not upto modern standards of comfort and service. Swimming pool was a disappointments - the shallow end was 1.5 metres, which meant people who are not serious swimmers cannot get into the pool at all."
This is a beautiful old colonial style hotel with a lovely pool and restaurant.
"We were given a different room to the one we booked which we agreed to as we were told it had a gorgeous view. The view was very mediocre and the room was tiny. It was obviously one half of a family room as there was a door connecting the room to another but there was a small table put in front of it. The poor guest in the adjacent room was violently ill all day, night and morning and we heard every bit of it. When we raised this at reception they just shrugged their shoulders....not good enough really for a hotel of this standard."
Still maintains colonial style.great seawater swimming pool with sea breeze to keep you comfortable in the heat. Reception staff really helpful
Nothing not to like!
"Was really looking forward to staying here again - I had fond memories of my stay several years ago. However on checking in I was told that the room (with double bed) I had booked over a month ago was not available. I was offered an ""upgrade"" - from Superior Queen to.... Superior Queen. That's some upgrade.Only after an argument with a second check-in member of staff was the mistake acknowledged, and I was offered a change of room for the following day.I feel I shouldn't have to argue with staff merely to have my original booking honoured. Very disappointing and a sour end to my holidays in Sri Lanka. I will not be using the Galle Face Hotel again."
"We had another very enjoyable stay at the hotel.First class service with very friendly staff who make you very welcome.Comfortable room ,good facilities and great location on sea front.Highly recommend."
Nothing
This is the fourth time I've stayed at Galle Face Hotel and I love it every time - a central location for the city right on the ocean.  Beautiful pool and restaurant areas and the careful room renovations still keep the hotel as special and characterful as before.
"Beautiful old building, felt like going back in time. Never did guided tour but would have been interested considering the people that had stayed here over the years. Raising and lowering of flag accompanied by bagpipes. Food good quality. "
"Beautiful luxurious historic colonial hotel, the restaurant food and drinks are expensive but service and food were of high quality.  We really enjoyed our stay here and loved having drinks on the terrace to watch the sunset.  Swimming pool area was great to relax and just outside the hotel door is the hustle and bustle of Colombo, however  as soon as you step inside it is is an oasis of calm.  Coffee was the best we had in Sri Lanka. Check out the hotel museum near the library room and see the famous people that stayed including a well known Cuban revolutionary!"
Nothing.
"Gorgeous heritage hotel in a grand colonial-style building. The verandah is an amazing spot to watch the sunset with a cocktail in hand. Rooms are spacious and the beds are very comfy, especially by Sri Lanka standards. Staff are lovely and friendly."
"The bathroom in our room was a little tired looking, but otherwise clean."
"This is the hotel to stay in when visiting Colombo. The staff were so helpful and lovely. The hotel is gorgeous and all the facilities are maintained to a very high standard. The pool and views are beautiful, food delicious and the hotel is very grand. A real luxury and brilliant first two nights in Sri Lanka. Definetly walk along Galle Face Green and head to the Ministry of Crab in a tuk tuk for dinner.... book first though."
Nothing
Beautiful old hotel. Lovely outdoor gardens. Book a suite room for complimentary access to the Long Room (free breakfast buffet and evening drinks). Staff were lovely and attentive. 
"Breakfast was good ,  Location on Galle face is excellent."
"First room offered very noisy, second room was found to be infested by sugar ants. Management tried to resolve all issues but in a short 2 night stay it's hard to keep moving rooms. I compare this hotel to Mount Lavinia hotel , sorry Guys you come second"
"Am a return guest so always good to go back and kindly upgraded my room, wouldn't stay anywhere else in Colombo . Excellent cocktails"
"Buffet style supper not as good as last time, but alone it's easier than sitting in one of the restaurants by oneself ."
"The hotel is in an excellent location next to the sea, with a pleasant outside bar area and pool, and very comfortable rooms. Staff were helpful."
The hotel was more expensive than we expected as we had not realised 30% tax was not included in the prices cited on the booking.com website.
The buffet breakfast was amazing and the views from the veranda just delightful for a great start to the day. The friendly staff and and beautiful building make this a place you should not miss staying in whilst in Sri Lanka.
Beautiful hotel
Wild new years party that took over the hotel. They provided no advanced notice. Party was extremely loud and went past 6am in the morning. We were not advised of the party ahead of time. Party goers snuck on to our balcony in the middle of the night causing mayhem. The hotel staff were surly and not helpful.
"We were in a relatively small room with 2 twin beds, but with a side view of the ocean, which we could still hear, and a very comfortable and cozy feeling overall.  Staff were very professional and accommodating; prices a little higher than other hotels we stayed at in Colombo, but not drastically so, and the beauty of the hotel overall easily made up for these small concerns.  Some of the other rooms we saw, going for a higher price, were spectacular, if you like a more colonial look.  Breakfast buffet was exceptionally good."
"Our room was a little small and, although the mini bar was free (a nice touch), there was no beer or wine or even chocolate in it as we expected from other hotels."
"We were welcomed and our bags taken care of, everyone spoke good english and it was the best customer service we had in all of Sri Lanka."
Pool bar staff could be a little quicker
"The place had character!Our room was very comfortable and so well appointed. All staff were very polite and helpful.Breakfast was plenteous and delicious.Dinner at the sea food restaurant was extremely good and our waiter so helpful."
Very little!
"I did not like the checkin cuz we arrived from an overseas trip at 7am and they let us in the lobby for 5 hours and did not offer us breakfast . After charging me 800 USD and after the long wait they tell us one room is ready and the room was not what I reserved.. and The charged me more money on my card 325 USD with out my authorization from me and that was done when I was standing in front of them I was shocked that I got msg from my bank I told them why when the manger check with fin dep he said sorry this will be reimbursed to my card and they did the same day cuz I was thereThe shocking thing after two days of checking out they changed me 708.14 USD and I called and they say it's holidays and they will back in my card I wish I was in Colombo so I can face them like the 325 dollars that they return right awayPlz booking.com , note this and help me ..P.s.I wish that I payed cash at this Hotel"
"Taking money with out my authorization, first time it happen to me in a 5 star hotel !!!!"
"The Galle Face Hotel is a beautiful piece of history. Set right on the beach, it offers lovely sunset viewing from the terrace restaurant or bar. The decor is a nice mix of modern and old; and the rooms are well appointed with comfy beds & pillows. Get a good spot on the porch/terrace, a nice cocktail & watch the sun go down while the piper plays & the flag is lowered. Very special."
Nothing
Liked the food and afternoon tea. And the historic touch. The pool is large.
Limited numbers of chairs by the pool. Surrounding area boring. No possibility to bath in the ocean depending on heavy Waves.
"An incredible hotel. If you want one night of luxury during your trip to Sri Lanka, stay here. Service is impeccable and the view from the pool can be stared at all day."
Nothing.
Galle Face hotel is an awesome place to stay in Colombo. It’s a beautiful hotel with an old colonial feel. The staff were lovely and the room was very comfortable.
"Lovely food - breakfast was just fabulous as was the evening mealLovely pool area and wonderful historyLovely old hotel with old world class"
Changing facilities near pool a bit basic
"Bit of a treat for us in a suite with balcony overlooking pool. We often stay in smaller places so when we do spend 5-10 times our usual nightly amount have certain hopes and expectations!!..... that the Galle Face achieved and exceeded! Great staff, excellent food,  beautiful old building, great location, nice little treats (like minibar goodies) , good pool, excellent room, complimentary fruit etc etc. My test is always ... .. would we spend this amount and stay again? 100% we would! Thanks!"
"The hotel itself was very nice. Great accommodations, amazing pool, great restaurants (more than 1 option which is great!)."
"Our room was not great. For what we paid, we got a room not overlooking anything that was much smaller than the images I saw when booking..."
"Lovely old hotel, great swimming pool and loved the sound of the waves crashing at night. Decent buffet breakfast and very good location to walk to other restaurants in the evening. Liked the pool bar especially at sunset"
The service could have been a bit better. Reception staff were good but the staff at breakfast were very slow!
We had a triple room for me and 2 teenagers. It was perfect with a seperate room with sofa bed and another TV and wel stocked barcfu of treats. The complimentary Long bar on the second floor for breakfast and happy hour was stunning.  The pool is nicely positioned looking over the each.
Not enough sun beds by the pool. Very noisy late at night with party music from downstairs.
"The fantastic heritage buildingSea view and nice bar, breakfast in the coursivesLocation"
"Old and slow elevatorsQuietness of rooms is poor: hearing strong waves and train being in the aisle facing the railwaySpa was under renovation but once finished it will be great"
"Very colonial in both architecture, aesthetics and feel. Good beachfront location, with friendly & helpful staff. Great food and sea views from the various seating areas."
The hotel itself is stunning and watching the sunset by the pool is quite remarkable however it is spoiled by hostile staff.
Although the hotel itself is beautiful the staff are shamefully unprofessional and unpleasant to deal with. Staff in the Verandah restaurant  are especially hostile which makes for a terrible start to the day. I didn’t appreciate the constant staring by male staff as I spent time by the pool.  Email and social media communication is appalling. You are not made to feel welcome at the this hotel. It is truly disappointing as the building itself is really breath taking.
"The buffet breakfast was comprehensive and tasty. The staff were very friendly and professional. Beautiful communal areas, this is a grand lady of a hotel."
"The gym was closed during my admittedly brief stay, and with the huge selection available at breakfast and the one evening meal I attended, I could have done with working out."
Good breakfast. Great pool. Lovely Colonial charm to this hotel.
Check in very lengthy process. We asked for connecting rooms and they couldn't accommodate us even though we were all one family so ended up on different floors. One room was much better than the other (view of the sea as opposed to the view of a brick wall) even though the prices were exactly the same. The breakfast is very nice. Good pool right on the beach. The staff were friendly.
"The location of the hotel being right at the waters edge wasamazing. Our room was sea facing and the sound of the waveswas therapy for a restful nights sleep."
"When we reached the hotel after a long drive fromNuwara Eliya , the welcome and check in was disappointing.Definitely not in keeping with the other 5 star hotels we use.The staff especially at the front desk were very impersonal.Unlike other 5 star hotels they were not very familiar with theirguests."
The Hotel is a superb example of colonial charm and decadence and is run with military precision. It is located in a prime part of Colombo and is located a short tuk tuk ride to places of interest. It was a treat to stay there and an experience we hope very much to repeat.
Nothing that could be improved upon by the hotel.
Location and outside look of hotel
"Very basic and old rooms.Price of booking was not respected. I was charged 40 USD on top of price of reservation without explanation, unacceptable!"
"Buffet was excellent, great choice and variety. Staff were very good, attentive and friendly."
"The pool was quite deep, even the shallow end which was very small, not good for a non swimmer. The room was a little smaller than I expected but quite comfortable. Also the spa and gym were out of service due to renovations. I was a little disappointed as I had intended to use the spa and using out off site is not the same experience."
Nice view of sea
"Room was pokey with lots of glitches. The temperature of the shower couldn’t be controlled so far too hot — and, despite having asked for it to be repaired, nothing was done even by the second day."
Got a free upgrade to a junior suite as we were early & our original room was not yet made. Beds super comfy!
The location of the room was right above the hall which played extremely loud music till 1130 the 2 nights we were there. It is impossible to sleep in that room.
clean good location and choice of breakfast was very good
took longer to check in and did not offer any drinks while we were waiting for the check in process
I thought the staff and the actual accommodation was the best part of our stay.  We ate in the seafood restaurant which was lovely.  Also the hotel had a lovely fragrant smell and is situated on the ocean.  We would look out of our hotel room and take in the scenery.
"The coffee wasn't the best but that's just my personal opinion, my husband enjoyed his coffee!"
The colonial feel
"There was a loud band on the first night on the floor below : loud enough to feel the music thru the floorboardsBut they finished up before midnight so all was OK"
"Sumptous breakfast, fantastic restaurant Seaspray 10 m from the ocean with waves crushing in and good seafood😊"
Difficult to communicate with them via email 😔 No answer!
"- Very attentive staff
- There is a lovely seafood restaurant downstairs
- Great selection for breakfast
"
"- Room felt a bit outdated, although I think that’s the look they are going for
- We got a tour from one of the hotel staff and it ended in the jewellery shop where we felt pressure to buy something. 
"
The room was outstanding as we got a free upgrade. Couldn't have asked for much more.
The adjoining room as we had noisy neighbours. We called the reception but it persisted until we had to get up for our flight at 5am.
Spacious bed room facing Galle Green. Breakfast is very well laid and carries variety of items - to meet the local and foreign pallet.
The layout of room could be ergonomically worked upon. Ironing board could be placed in room and lighting system needs improvement.
The pool was the best thing about the hotel.
"The Spa was being renovated - didn't know this in advance.The staff were not as accommodating and helpful as you would expect at a hotel of this level.  The restaurant could do with some sort of air conditioning - pretty uncomfortable in the heat."
"Lovely history and ambiance and location, and very good staff (as we encountered all over Sri Lanka).  On my request, the hotel laid on some flowers and a cake for my wife's birthday which was well appreciated"
"Thought the room was a little small but then everywhere else on our travels we had extremely large rooms, so maybe we were spoilt a little.  I also thought that what we paid for our kind of balcony room was well over the top"
Breakfast was good with a wide variety.staff where very nice and helpful
"Room felt standard whilst you where paying for luxury. Bar was expensive and didn’t seem alot to do around the property, also there was a small beach but swimming was prohibited"
Still charming despite the recent renovations. Especially liked the Veranda Bar & Sea Spray restaurant with its excellent sea food.
"Having arrived from Delhi on a morning flight, I reached the Galle Face at about 11am & had to wait two hours before a room was available -- and I was extremely tired!"
"A seemless blend of old and new with all the charm and convenience that you would expect.Gin and tonic sundowners - excellent."
Beware the pork sausages at breakfast.
Lovely old hotel with original features. Spacious room with sea views.
The staff seemed largely indifferent (unlike other places in Sri Lanka). Room was spacious but bathroom in need of refurbishment (bath sealant was black and toilet flush problematic). Had agreed check out at 1pm but at 12.45 received call asking why we hadn't checked out. Wifi access ceased immediately on checkout so had to ask for extension whilst we waited for our driver (10 minutes extra was provided). Buffet meals were OK but expensive whilst fish restaurant prices based on price per 100g so no indication of final cost.
"Very friendly and  courteous staff. Room was fantastic, Beautiful and clean. The view from the room was breathtaking. Food was marvellous. Enjoyed the fruit basket. Wish I had more days booked."
"Colonial charm, excellent food, very helpful staff. The breakfast buffet was wonderful with extensive local and western options. We had a huge room with a few of the stormy ocean. Excellent value compared to other places we stayed. "
"Looking a bit run down, patchy paint, broken gutters"
It is a beautiful hotel to stay in. It was a treat to ourselves at the end of our holiday after staying in guest houses for the rest of the holiday. It has a bit more character than most posh hotels. We loved it. The food was excellent too.
There's really nothing not to like.
The bed was very comfortable and we were in a good position near the pool and spa. The staff are very friendly and helpful.
"The spa was closed and we were not informed. The checkerboard terrace was not available because of weddings. The bridal preparation room was directly opposite ours so there was a lot of disturbacnce, especially at night after 11:00pm from the wedding party."
Grand hotel with a rich history. Lovely sea views. Excellent breakfast at The Verandah. Sea water swimming pool is quite unique. 
"Staff, though friendly and well mannered, were often slow to respond to basic requests. Gym and Spa were closed for renovation during our stay. "
This hotel has a very special and unique ambience---I would rate it amongst the top three hotels I have stayed at the past 10 years (and I have stayed at more than a 100) The old-world feel combined with the beauty of the surroundings make for a super vacation. The staff (all the staff) went out of their way to be friendly and helpful; day and night. The different restaurants offered a splendid variation of dining options at reasonable prices
I liked everything
"Great historic hotel. Room was large with a large modern bathroom.Pool area has great views right on the beach front. Breakfast restaurant had a good variety of quality food in a nice location.Hotel is walking distance to the Old Dutch Hospital so good for tourists"
The location was beautiful. The hotel itself is beautiful and the full of history. The room was larger and clean and comfortable. The restaurant is very good.
"Nothing really. You can't swim at their beach because of safety considerations, but that's not a big deal."
Beeing just direkt by the sea!
The Hotel inside should have more colours! The corridors are too dark and smell  as they were built 3000 years ago.... Also the poolside and surrounding looks poor and not fresh. You have not even enough sombrellos for every guest.... needs definitely renovation work. And the small sunshelter above the windows shiuld be painted yellow!! The hotel would then look fresher and more interesting!!also needs definitely more trees outside!
The hotel is a grand old colonial building with great staff and a lovely terraces. The seafood restaurant was excellent and good value for money.
Parts of the hotel looked a little tired and our room was small and dark.
"The breakfast buffet was fabulous with a range of Sri Lankan curries, hoppers, and western options like croissants and eggs."
No hooks in the bathroom for hanging clothes.
It is an awful destination. The price of this hotel is never $195.
"Exuberant price, low quality, and untrustworthy booking.com website. Galle face hotel is an awful very expensive hotel."
"The location is great, right next to galle face green and it is on the beach. Although you can not swim at the beach, it was perfect for viewing sunsets."
The service by staff could be hit and miss. For the most part the service was great.
"We were made to feel welcome and comfortable throughout the entire day and night until our midnight flight, even though we had checked out in the morning. Also gave us a later checkout and assisted us with our phone issues."
Leaving the property to explore Colombo😮
Beautiful hotel. Loved being able to hear the sounds of the ocean from the room. Excellent fine dining restaurant on site. Room was very comfortable.
Front desk/concierge could have been more helpful with questions we had.
"The breakfast was wonderful. For us it was the welcome to lovely Sri Lanka , and the bed made us rest to recover from our trip ...really comfortable  "
Nothing 
"I loved that the building was this an old colonial building, with so much history. I especially loved that the pool was a sea water pool."
"I dealt with a young recruit for check-in &check out. And while he had the best intentions, he was quite inexperienced and it became an unduly delayed check out.Also, one of our rooms smelt fowl (some problem with the toilet). They were kind enough to change the room.The superior rooms were very small & tight to negotiate."
"Staff services excellent. I got  a room with sea view+harbour. Room service food very good. enjoyed the stay. will come again to stayBeds very good. laundry services excellent Bathroom was at a good standing  complementary bar fridge free of charge."
the room bar fridge leeching and the room phone not working. Staff helped to repair same.
Loved the location . Very close to Galle Face Walk and Colombo.
Our room was comfortable but old. We invited family for dinner and we were very disappointed with the buffet. The people in charge at the restaurant were not very friendly. It was clearly just a job to them . Disappointing
"This is a hotel that is a good 150 years old. It is right at the heart of Colombo.We loved the food and ambience of the restaurants, the only salt water pool by the sea and the fact that it was so connected. The Main Street and the Dutch hospital are nearby where we wanted to visit."
There was a wedding at the lower level which created some noise for a bit literally thumping on our floor.
"Breakfast was incredible!! One of the best we've had in Sri Lanka .. Sri Lankan curry was spot on. And for those not eating Sri Lankan food such a good spread of continental breakfast. Great quality and taste. The restaurants and bar are right by the sea .. incredible views. Absolutely beautiful property"
We got our rooms 2 hours after check in time
I have been staying at the galle face for over three decades. I love the atmosphere and for me it's always like home
While I understand that the hotel needed refurbishment it has lost a lot of its character. Sofas in the galle instead of Sri Lankan rathan chairs and chaise lounges and no information of the historical role of the hotel and the people who stayed there
"I loved the location and the room. The staff were polite but totally inefficient- had to ask them for service several times before they even responded and repeat the request several times after which they got it wrong.The High Tea was awful. There was too much bread in the finger sandwiches and not enough fillings. Too few savouries. Poor quality cakes. The service was appalling. I had to ask for tea for one of my guests several times - I had to repeat myself to 3 different waiters who all got it wrong though I speak fluent English and Sinhalese and repeated my very simple request many times in both languages. In Colombo there are many hotels including  4 and 5 star hotels and restaurants that do high tea and this was the worst high tea I have ever had in Sri Lanka. Tourists probably think this is the high tea in Sri  Lanka and they would be wrong!The hotel advertises airport transfers which should be free but they tried to charge me an exorbitant fee. I called a local taxi ( Kangaroo cabs 0112 285 285) and got  an air conditioned saloon car with a polite and efficient driver for Rs 2850/- for my flight at 3 am we left at 12:45 am and was at the airport by 1:15 and my driver got me a trolley and loaded my bags onto it too . Don't waste you money and take a hotel taxi which costs about $80 (Rs 12,345) Breakfast was bad too. A tip stay there for the ambience if you like but walk across ( a short distance) to Cinnamon Grand have their high tea and breakfasts and food."
Service and food both appalling
the junior suite was spacious with many complimentary services.
The bottom sheet on the bed wasn't made properly and kept coming untucked ... this is the only thing I can find wrong!!
"I’ve booked the hotel for 5 nights, when I booked it showed that it had a gym and spa, but when I got there the gym and the spa was closed for renovations, I told the hotel that I want to cancel my stay in the hotel, and the staff was so helpful and booking.com customer support helped me too, the hotel offered me an upgrade to suit, but i said no and they only charged me the night I stayed and refunded rest of the money, The hotel is beautiful, nice sea view, and stuff was so helpful."
They gym and spa was under renovation
Good breakfast buffet - worth the extra charge
Relatively pricy hotel for Sri Lankan standards and doesn't really live up to its 5 star promise: Neither the rooms not the service is as good as it should be.
"Food was good, staff by pool and in the restaurants were nice."
Reception staff left our luggage sitting out in a corner of reception where anyone could have taken them. They didn't ask for our tag when we took our luggage from there. When I complained reception staff laughed in my face and were very rude.
Great atmosphere. Delicious food at the fish restaurant (quite pricey though). Pleasant service. Spacious and comfortable room.
The Spa has been under renovation for a long time now so there is no spa or gym available. This does not appear to be considered in the room rates.
B'fast
"Porters Service on Checkout. None one took any initiative to load our luggage into our car. We were getting late for our flight. Finally our nephew had to take the car keys from the doorman and he him selves went to the car park drove the car to the front entrance and started loading our luggage.Porters were standing and watched us. The Manager on duty came and told them to Hurry  up and load our luggage . Then two porters started moving. Hotel has a strong mold smell. Over spray of air freshers in the lobby and in corridors. We were upgraded to a junior suite. I would not call that a junior suite. It is large double room for us."
"Public areas and restaurants here were wonderful- historic, stylish and full of character. Staff could not do enough to make us comfortable. Breakfast was superlative, and all meals were excellent and reasonably priced for a hotel of this type. We stayed here twice. On our first visit our room was very disappointing- poorly maintained, and overlooking a noisy building site. When we checked out, I spoke to the manager and expressed my concern that upon our return in two weeks, we would not have a similar room. He was most responsive, and when we returned, we had a hugely upgraded room, enormous,  with sweeping views."
"Some rooms are very ordinary- old and badly maintained. If you are given one of these, ask for a room change."
"I liked very little about this hotel. Rooms are large, airy and quite comfortable."
"Ambiance nice and it's all spruced up and restored, however, management and staff attitudes leave much to be desired. Staff seem to be more interested in talking to each other or on their mobile phones than paying attention to guests and their needs. I stood for five minutes at the restaurant overlooking the sea in front of two staff members who continued to talk with each other rather than attend do me and show me to a table till I interrupted them. In the bar, there were staff members everywhere, however, the service was awful! I think they all need re-training. Doormen on the main entrance had the strange habit of holding the door open with a foot so guests could enter or exit while they talked on the phone. On my last night, there was a huge row in the room above me with things seemingly being thrown around and occupants shouting at each other. It woke me at 0400 and continued till 0600 when it suddenly stopped. Hotel management did not seem to be able to stop it."
Location is great and the restaurants serve excellent buffet lunch and dinner.
"The old wing was a bit dated (especially the toilet) despite the renovation. The second night we stayed at the new wing, which has better decoration (new room) but we were bombarded with loud music from the ballroom nearby. Loud music didn't stop until 10:45pm and we had an early flight. Very frustrating."
Staff absolutely lovely. Breakfast was delicious...so many things to choose from. Didn't need to eat again until late evening! Lovely to see this colonial building maintain its traditional look and feel. Amazing views.
"This is odd but the overpowering smell in the lobby made me dizzy! It's like lillys mixed with some exotic airfreshner and I couldn't stay in there too long, it gave me a headache! The walls are pretty thin unfortunately so I was disturbed in my sleep a couple of times. "
"We were five people, who requested 2 rooms next to each other. But that wasn't given. Then when we all spent some time together in one room, the manager remarked that they don't allow so many people in one room, which was odd. We had rude people staying next door, and the manager almost justified their behavior."
"Lovely old colonial hotel, great bar and restaurant overlooking the sea and nice pool. Very comfortable room and great bathroom. A good place to stay."
"Lovely period property, complete with museum about the hotel's fascinating history. Right on the beach and facing the Galle Face green, where kids fly kites and families walk along the sea. The newly renovated wing is definitely better as the older wing smells a little damp."
"I'd have liked more la carte options (and local food over international), as there seems to be a love of buffet dining."
"A grand old hotel which has retained it's old time feel. The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable. a great hotel breakfast on the terrace and swim in the generous pool overlooking the ocean, made it even better."
Room had no view
Everything in this hotel was according to what we expected. History reflected everywhere and the verandas were beautiful. The breakfast location was amazing whereas the hotel was very centrally located. The room facilities were very good and I will gladly stay here again.
Loved the history of the bus.ding and the renovation of it was beautiful. Pool was lovely and the food and service amazing.
Our room didn't have a great view but we weren't there all that long. Probably a bit overpriced.
"The whole place is steeped in history and has a luxurious colonial feel. Its a nice experience to sit and enjoy a location where so many famous characters have visited and although it is expensive for Sri Lanka it is good value compared to similar hotels in England, even if only for a night. We enjoyed the buffet and cocktails and felt it was a lovely closing evening to our holiday in Sri Lanka."
This hotel is fabulous from its setting to its history it has everything to make your stay a sweet memory. Staff are superb and the food excellent. Several restaurants within hotel to suit all budgets. Rooms great and spacious. Can't praise this hotel enough.
Great property with a lot of history attached to it. The staff was extremely polite and helpful. Central location being itself a tourist attraction. Even the sunset high teas were memorable 
"Everything. From the view to architecture, the hotel is awesome. Only problem was, we got old wing and not the renovated one even though, we paid similar price. But barring that, everything else was just perfect. "
Rooms in the old wing and not the renovated one. 
Colonial hotel in prime condition. Nice fish resteraunt.
Offered an an inferor room to that booked. Had to view 5 rooms to get an apropriate one. Needed to be persistent. It's expensive paid £675 for 2 nights with dinner.
"Was not worth at all for the paid amount, nothing was good to tell about the property. There was no proper n immediate response from staffs at reception."
"Nothing i liked there to share, there was no door for bathing place..... wooden flooring in room was uncomfortable..... not sufficient light   "
Excellent  spread of  food. Great view of  sunset in the evening. Staff who understand  what personalized service is all about.
Hoped  for a greater blend of modern tech with the grandeur of the past era.
"beautiful views from the room. room excellent excellent service from the new fish restaurant overlooking the beach"
surly service at the main patio dining room. unhelpful and infriendly manager
"Lovely beds, lovely staff. Really beautiful and historical hotel. Loved the food that was served around the pool."
Couldn't fault anything except for the small lift!
"Great staff that knows the true value of customer service special mention for reception and the restaurant first class service.  if you are going to Colombo, this is the best hotel to stay in. it just shows part of Colombo history."
"The old British style building is amazing. The service is extraordinary and the location couldn't be better. If you book a Suite, you have access to the executive lounge, where you can enjoy delicious snacks and an fantastic view."
"Design of the furniture, flooring, bathroom was nice, prestige factor"
"Windows were very dirty, the hotel staff expects the guests to tip generously all the time, slippery floorboards in the main restaurant (i fell down), there were total of 3 guests, they did not bring extra bath towels, bath robes and extra cups, loud maintenance work was being done next door, our room had a view to the sea but also the garbage area"
"Truly historic hotel, beautiful colonial building and fabulous sunset views from the bar. Breakfast the best we had in Sri Lanka and lovely salt water pool, even in the rain!"
The rooms we were given were small and with the wooden floors soundproofing was an issue. I appreciate it is a very old building but I think you pay for the name when you come here. Time again I'd probably go for a sunset drink but not stay.
I was charged double as they had my credit card in their system. And the staff refused to rwsolve the issue with booking.com. and  no reply from customer services of booking. Com
Roons stink
"Deluxe hotel, great location right on the waterfront and the Galle Face Green. Excellent buffet dinner."
Strong smell of sewage from somewhere nearby made evening poolside drinks unpleasant one night.
Absolutely everything ....it was a real treat to come back to The Galle Face. I recommended it to friends and the 4 of us spent 3 night there. BUT...........
"As 4 ""seniors"", we were grateful and delighted with the upgrade given to us when we arrived.  I was unable to book this hotel in 1985 and it was a dream to finally stay there after all these years.
All was superb. BUT.... On our last night, we went to bed at 9pm  as my partner was suffering from food poisoning.  But it was impossible to rest or sleep due to unbearable loud music which actually made the whole room and bed vibrate, it was so loud. The noise apparently was coming from a large function directly below our room. By around 10.45pm, I had had enough and went down to the reception in my dressing gown. The night manager came up and politely agreed the noise was unexceptionable. He said I was not the only room which had complained. He offered the choice of another room (what? change rooms with a sick man in tow?), move to the room's slightly quieter lounge area which has a sofa couch (Still not acceptable with the price we were paying), and a pot of green tea. The latter was accepted along with the promise that the music would stop at 11.30. Well, the noise certainly was reduced but absolutely not eliminated. So, around midnight, my partner, who had had no sleep to assist with his sickness, asked me to call reception and we complained yet again. By this time, we were so upset and angry...sleep was simply not possible for some hours.
What I want to ask is...
1. Why are you...a 5 star hotel, subjecting your guests to this unacceptable disturbance, when you must know that the noise which affects this and other rooms is unacceptable....under any circumstances.
2. Isn't your guests experience at your hotel of paramount importance?
3. Why do you not block these rooms from sale when you must know you will get dissatisfied guests and risk complaints.
 On checkout....Nothing was offered to me in compensation and I had to re-iterate the story plus exhibit  strong dissatisfaction before the duty front office manager eventually reduced our bill."
"Staff were very friendly and helpful, they could not do enough for you. Although service in the travellers bar was rather slow. Breakfast was very good with uninterrupted views of the sea. Our room was very comfortable although slightly on the small side for the price. The free mini bar was a good plus too"
The spa and gym facilities were closed.
"Comfortable beds, good shower. Complimentary minibar with soft drinks and snacks. Staff were helpful. A lovely hotel but some disappointing aspects marred the overall experience."
Gym and sauna were closed. The view from our room wasn't great. 'Superior room' isn't superior by any standards.
This is a beautifully restored colonial building that oozes history. The level of luxury for the price is above and beyond what I had expected. My room was also HUGE! The location is about as good as you can get; though the area is quite pricey.
"Absolutely stunning, a real treat of a hotel to spend the last night of our Sri Lanka holiday. Definitely worth checking in and spending most of the time there! Just had a superior room and it was gorgeous, lovely furnishings, FREE minibar, view of the pool/sea, welcome lemonade and fudge, the most elegant and courteous staff. The hotel has so much to offer you barely need to leave."
"Outside of windows was a bit foggy so was not really a clear view, but that didn't matter much - we were not there to spend the day in our room!"
We tried to change our booking to a tariff (booking.com) to include breakfast but it seemed all too hard. The hotel never responded to our request and on arrival they told us we should have contacted Booking.com but that is never easy either.
"From floorboard to furniture in the lobbies, the whole atmosphere breathes Campherwood, Teak and Ebony. One expects to find Agatha Christie or Lord Mountbatten sipping tea under the Verandah. Class and charm."
backpackers and batik pants just don't fit there but money has no smell it seems.
The hotel was beautiful old world charm.  The flag lowering in the evening was beautiful with the playing of the bagpipes.
"We would have liked a larger room, quite expensive for the size"
"Great breakfast buffet, excellent cocktails, good room."
"Staff couldn't find my reservation, which was kind of annoying. Strange inconsistencies. I stayed here twice on the same trip, First time, no welcome drink, but bottled water and fruit provided poolside. Second stay, there was a welcome drink, but no water or fruit poolside. For this price, it should be consistent. Food at the dinner buffet not as good as breakfast, and should be avoided."
"The historical charm, the seawater swimming pool and unique surroundings."
"Nothing, aside few behaviours amongst occupants forgetting manners (noise and outfit)."
"This was the second time we stayed at this hotel. After a first experience rather poor, now we had a much better room in the renovated wing with a great sea view."
Magnificent view of the ocean.  Bar staff seemed the happiest.
"Service at the breakfast restaurant was below standard.  Every staff seem harried.  The floors were grimy and looks like the balustrades and blinds have not been cleaned for ages.  Worse, a party was going on all night on Saturday and they stuck us in the wing that had the music the loudest.  Thank goodness we stayed only for one night for a connecting flight."
Excellent location with a nice variety of eating venues. Easy access to the Green and not far by transport to major sites of interest.
"Poor signs, easy to get lost and to find venues. Needs a better informed tourist desk and disappointed they charged us over double the taxi fare back to the airport."
The wow factor as you walk in the hotel.  The hotel has plenty of history and the facilities are excellent.  The staff are polite but a little care free for my liking.  Good value considering it one of Sri Lankas best hotels.
Lack of beach in front of the hotel. Staff could do note to provide premium service.  The swimming pool could be bigger considering the size of the hotel.  Lack of warm greeting and lack of warm send off.
"A beautifully restored colonial hotel in a great location.  The grounds, swimming pool, bars and restaurants are lovely with gorgeous views out to sea. A delicious buffet breakfast too."
"Large, clean bathroom, the pool and restaurants are very nice. We had one of the best meals of our time in Sri Lanka in the seafood restaurant. The hotel has a strange, antique quality to it which isn't exactly luxurious but has an old-world charm that's quite unique, especially in an area of Colombo that's changing so dramatically."
"We were initially ""upgraded"" to a suite which was dark and oddly laid out with chipped paint all over the balcony as it was next to the renovations. To be fair we were quickly moved to a smaller but far nicer room. The rooms are a little dated for a five star rating but it's still good value. Gym and spa currently closed for renovations."
"I have stayed in many nice hotels around the world but I have to say I believe this is the best I've ever stayed. Location is excellent on the coast. The quality of finish and decor of the hotel public areas, rooms and bathrooms is superb. Some of the art work, particularly the terracotta wall in reception made me very envious. However the biggest accolade must go to the staff. Every single staff member we met was polite, attentive, helpful and cheerful. I must congratulate everyone at the hotel and cannot recommend it highly enough"
"Expeccially the food was outstanding. After 3 Weeks travelling in Sri Lanka, the food was here for us 8 people the best. The mixture of all the ingredients was astonishing and inspiring. Our room - first floor was rather little but nice."
All of us did not really appreciate that waiters took our plates and glasses when we were eating. They seemed too quick in this. Transportation to the airport with the hotel van is very expensive!
"The hotel has a real sense of history and is very elegant and stylish.  The staff were all very helpful and attentive.  The breakfast buffet was magnificent, and the choice of food at the restaurants in house also excellent.  The saltwater pool is lovely and big. The history tour, museum and library also all very interesting.  Great location and view out to the ocean.  Perfect place to return to and relax after venturing out in to the hustle, bustle and heat of Colombo, particularly if you have just arrived in SL and need to acclimatise.  We were also interested to witness the wedding that took place during our stay and the daily traditional lowering of the flag at sunset heralded by a bagpiper in full regalia!"
The spa and gym were closed for renovations.  We were however given the option to use a gym in a nearby hotel.  Beds not that comfortable.
"The staff were very friendly, we were greeted a refreshing lime juice after a very long journey from the UK. The location is near to Colombo Fort train station."
Nothing
"Old school charming hotel, polite and good staff. Very good salt water pool."
"One room (#2021) was problematic due to extreme humidity accumulating, but we had it changed and did not pay for that night."
"Hotel has a ""traditional feel"" of luxury all through. WE only stayed for one night on the way through Colombo but I had to drag the wife and kids (all over 18) away as they were enjoying the rooms / feel / views so much. Would thoroughly recommend"
hit check in at a busy period but they handled it well
The service at Galle Face was exceptional and it is the most wonderful hotel to stay at. Gorgeous views from our room and the entire hotel. The pool and restaurant by the beach were divine. An absolute must to stay and very good value for money.
Nil
Lovely hotel at a very convenient location. The pool and views are breathtaking and perfect for a relaxing drink or two! The hotel amenities and service was excellent.
"The hidden 30% taxes that are applied on top of the room rate on booking.com. This was not the case at any of our other stays in Sri Lanka A triple room consisted of 2 beds where neither was able to fit 2 adults comfortably. Perhaps a queen and a single is more suitable for rooms expecting 3 guests. A concierge service for train tickets, short distance transport etc would have been helpful for a hotel of this class."
"A beautiful must in Colombo! It was a perfect way to start our holiday in Sri Lanka - we got to taste a little of the colonial history from the beginning and was ready to experience the amazing Sri Lankan culture further. Just a unique historic experience - and at the same time great luxury. Funny to see all the pictures in the bar of the famous people who have stayed at the hotel during its long life. The morning buffet was spetacular - and the passion daiquiry too :-)In the evening we walked a long the shore from the hotel to the old Dutch hospital where we had a great Sri Lankan meal (20 mins walk)"
"There was a historic tour around the hotel in the afternoon, which we missed since we saw the information about it too late. They should have informed about this when we arrived. We would have loved to experience this too. The pool area is not safe for small kids - as there is no fence or border from the sun-beds to the very dangerous rocks and high waves just underneath. Keep the kids close :-) The somewhat nasty and cheeky crows (that rules the Colombo area) are pretty annoying in the pool area - they will steal your food if you look away for just 20 seconds."
"We had a great experience at this hotel.  I cannot fault it in any way.  Very comfortable, great setting.  I would stay here again."
Their communication could be improved.
Luxurious hotel in a great location. The whole hotel smells amazing and it's very high quality. Seaspray restaurant was brilliant.
The gym was closed for refurbishment and though there was another in walking distance down the road this was inconvenient. The restaurants are not great value for money considering the general price to eat out in Sri Lanka. Also a large group of teenagers - some sort of sports tour - we're a bit rowdy and swearing around the pool during our stay.
"Good location, staff couldn't be nicer or more helpful. We left a kindle & they sent it by courier to our next hotel (150km away) at no extra cost. Now THAT Is good service!!"
"Not much, it was very good!"
The staff were very friendly & helpful
Original room was in the old fashioned end of the hotel & it was in need of some renovation but they upgraded us to a junior suite (for an extra £30/ night) which was an amazing room with beautiful sea views
"The perfect place to start your Sri Lankan adventure. The hotel was so old world and you could imagine the British royals staying there in the Past. Breakfast overlooking he ocean was lovely, staff were super helpful and the door man in his regal 50 years of service uniform was special. We felt so comfortable, safe and walked everywhere because it was smack bang in the Centre. Highly recommend, beautiful service. "
"What an amazing hotel!  We arrived late afternoon, and checked out the following morning to travel onwards to Kandy which really didn't give us enough time to appreciate this beautiful hotel!  Our room was wonderful; the separate lounge area with sofa bed for our son was perfect.  We had dinner at The Veranda - a wonderful buffet with a wide selection of courses and dishes.  Breakfast in the morning was also lovely with a wide choice.  Really wish we had more time to stay and fully explore this wonderful historic hotel."
"The night of our stay there was a wedding at the hotel -  a wonderful venue!  However, when we returned to our room following dinner, it sounded like the wedding party was taking place in our room, especially when the live band started.  We phoned the reception who told us the music finished at 11.30pm.  We asked if they had earplugs, which they didn't, but did offer to move us. This wasn't ideal at 10pm, but we moved to a suite in an older part of the hotel, away from the noise.  However, the room was cold, unwelcoming and did not have the bed required for our son.  Staff brought us blankets to make up a bed on the floor with the cushions from a sofa, which was far from ideal and we decided to move back to our original room and put up with the noise.  I'm not sure what the hotel can do regarding the noise when there is a wedding or an event - maybe at least let guests know, and provide earplugs!!"
"Nice building, well located.  Excellent service at the seafood restaurant."
"Surrounding areas are not so clean, but that has nothing to do with the hotel"
"The general feel of the hotel is of past glories and a beautiful colonial heritage.  The breakfast buffet on the terrace was heavenly. The rooms were beautifully presented and falling asleep listening to the roar of the ocean was something everyone should experience in their lifetime.The pool was lovely and deep and great for swimmers."
"There were one or two members of staff that were on the top of their game but, in general, we found the staff surly.  I suspect this is due to the hotel's incredible history and them being used to celebrity guests.  The house cleaning staff were incredibly polite and sweet though.On the Saturday a house music event was set up and when i say blasted, the music BLASTED out from around 2pm despite only 10 people being their until about 6.  There should have been volume control until people actually arrived. It ruined the day and i like housemusic. Also, i had booked two sea view rooms; one was exactly what we wanted, sea facing, the other faced out to the car park and along the park alongside the sea front.  Yes, we could see the sea, but it was out of the corner of the window and the noise was predominantly traffic."
Can not say enough about this place. They hit the mark every time. Wonderful staff and management respecting this beautiful hotel by being the best the can be. Loved every moment. Excellent location. The best.
"The one single thing I could say is, that like everywhere in Sri Lanka the beer could have been a touch colder."
"The pool party made our stay unbearable. We were informed that on our second night there would be a pool party and therefore the pool would remain closed. What we were not told was that the noise, vibration and discomfort would remain for the full twelve hours, noon till midnight. We were fed up, left the hotel for several hours and came back to the torture as we had a flight to catch in the morning. I don't think i will be staying at this hotel again.The staff were polite but not very knowledgeable. they had no idea how i could comment on the hotel and its services. When i asked for 2 postcards to be mailed, they simply gave me the stamps and charged me. All 5* hotels i have stayed at never charged and simply mailed the cards for me. i think the Galle Face has a lot to learn before they can be considered world class."
Hotel is well located near all good restaurant's. sea view was amazing. The staffs are very helpful.
"Friday till late night could hear from the room loud music going on the main floor was annoying. Spa,gem was under renovation which was not told at booking time was disappointing."
"Grand hotel with olde world ambience, good views"
"The extra 30% tax/service charges should have been disclosed up front - turns a $60 bottle of wine into an $80 one, the same goes for the room charge. No need to hide it and booking.com should consider that too as can be described as estimates. Shower had only one setting - boiling - the tap made no difference."
"Staff is good , selection of food"
"Room we were staying rather old fashion timber designWe prefer more modern roomDoors are quite heavy to openDoor key holewas rather low to openIroning board was too low to iron"
Definitely the breakfast was the best of our Galle Face experience.  A spectacular choice of fresh products from all over the world. The location is wonderful right in front of the beach. Great service as well. It is worth a 8 score just for that!
"Humidity, limited space in the standard rooms."
Service and food quality
Don't like Booking.com quoting only net and not actual price (plus 31% service charges & Govn tax).  Lets have real price.  Anything else is deception
"Staff were extremely accommodating and polite, couldn't fault them in any way. A massive plus was on our check out day, as the hotel wasn't that busy we were allowed to stay in our room for a couple of extra hours! Which made a world of difference to our plans."
Be careful with the alcohol- Not sure if what is written in the menu is a true reflection of the total price of the drink.
"The hotel is beautiful, but it is really old, and it smells old. The breakfast is okay but nothing amazing. It is located in front of the beach, reason why I booked this property. However, if you are looking to stay there, BE VERY CAREFUL WITH YOUR BELONGINGS - my two Pandora bracelets (worth more than 2,500 USD dollars were stolen from my room to be never found)."
"My two Pandora bracelets (worth more than 2,500 dollars) were stolen from my room)."
"Excellent breakfast options. Lovely room in the older part of the hotel (we had stayed in the newer section previously). Great pool. Great location - close proximity to Galle Face Green where we experienced some of the festivities for Poson Poya. A short walk to the tourist shopping area of the Dutch Hospital."
Transport options provided by the hotels private cars  (to the train station / hotel) are very over-priced. It's worth getting some numbers of companies and arranging this yourself.
"the breakfast was lovely .. the views of the ocean great. the hotel is lovely with its old architecture and good refurbishment. the overall ambience was lovely good location accessible to public transport and walking to many areas  wifi was good"
the bed was too hard for me
"The Galle Face hotel was absolutely beautiful, and the perfect way for us to end our stay in Sri Lanka. The staff were friendly and willing to help.Our room was lovely comfortable, very clean and furnished to a high standard.It was well located, on the sea front close to lots of great restaurants etc."
"The room was great, lovely products in the bathroom, the pool was wonderful after a day in the heat. I loved the sea breeze. The breakfast was AMAZING as were the cocktails. I wish we could have stayed longer."
Gym and spa were being renovated
This is an estate from another era. Great history and location
It's an old place that could use a renovation. Food was average nothing impressive. Spa and gym closed without any warning. We stayed at the junior ocean suite which was definitely overpriced.
Comfy beds.
Put us in a noisy  room to start with but moved us to a sea facing one. Staff weren't very friendly at all. No one to take our bags when we arrived. Not good considering it's supposed to be 5 star.
Gorgeous old world style. Amazing breakfasts. Amazing location overlooking the ocean. Great place to rest and retreat to after the craziness of colombo. Great 30m swimming pool. Loved it.
"Every thing was fairly good , staff , breakfast , bed comfort , location, wifi , TV channels , and above all front office staff who upgraded us to a suite which made our stay unforgettable."
Gym and Spa were under renovation and booking.com did not provide this information while booking.
"Great located beatiful hotel next to the sea (not for swimming). Felt like a dream. Perfect long pool. Good restaurants (lunch at Travellers Bar, diner at Sea Spray). Specious room. Best breakfast ever had ik a five star hotel. Stay in the hotel and do not get out for anything."
Fitness and spa were under construction during our stay (6th to 7th of May) so could not use them. Would have been better for a perfect five star hotel to have notified us at check in and maybe even give a small discount. Because our room was above the spa we heard loud drilling sounds for a half hour around 4:30 pm (which happened to be during our afternoon nap). Would also have been better to warn us in front and give us a choice for another room in case we would might some drilling sounds.
"The whole hotel was beautiful. Our rooms had a wonderful view and we appreciated the upgrade that let us enjoy adjoining rooms.Room service for our dinner was so good."
I had very clearly stated to Booking.Com and a separate mail was also sent to the property that I will be paying in cash and in the local currency. Inspite of this I was charged the $ tariff which is much higher than the tariff for local currency payment. I do not think that this is right.
"Sitting amongst the newer high rise hotels in Colombo, Galle Face Hotel still maintains its colonial character. The staff are immensely friendly and couldn't do enough for you and they take great pride in their jobs and the hotel. The pool is lovely! Although I somehow got it into my head that it was an inifinity pool, I was still pleasantly surprised! And the cocktails by the poolside were an added bonus.... particularly with the happy hour!! The breakfast was the best buffet breakfast I have ever had with a great selection of both continental, English and Sri Lankan choices! Oh and the fact that champers is included I was in my element! I thoroughly recommend the evening buffet too. Again, great selection cooked to a high standard. The rooms, although a little small, were still very comfortable."
Everything apart from the additional charges was great
"Premier Ocean View room was really large with a 'four poster' Jacuzzi as the centrepiece. Location at the South end of Galle Face Green was absolutely perfect for what we needed.Loved the daily ceremony of the bagpipes when the flag is lowered at sunset."
Slowish service in the main bar.
Hotel has an old world charm. The breakfast was excellent which much choice and champagne. A nice big cool salt water swimming pool. Lobby and breakfast areas were maintained beautifully.
Service at check in was poor. We were handed our key and pointed in the direction of our room. A hotel of this reputation should have staff to show us to our room and show us the facilities of the hotel.  The rooms are tired and do not seem to be maintained as well as their public areas. We also had booked a room for 3 adults and our room was set up for two people.  This was rectified by the hotel upon request.

Our room could have had a better view of the ocean

Lovely hotel with good standards and charm.
Wanting  a few hundred dollars as deposit in case u lost your key!!

Swimming pool- shallow end was nearly 5ft deep? Not good for kids.  Short break
"Very relaxing place to relax, take day trips and spa trips - very well appointed"
"For a city hotel you are located on the Indian Ocean, although you cant swim in the sea the pool is excellent."
Verandah restaurant and bar are beautiful spaces for meals and an afternoon drink
A musty smell the bedrooms
Beautiful hotel. Great location

"Pool operations, And I think Sauna and steam not available or then under renovation"
Beautiful hotel with great location and service ! The concierge team was extremely prompt and very helpful right through ! Historic hotel and great breakfast made the hotel worth every penny !
Lovely old hotel. Staff were wonderful. The museum inside was very interesting. Buffet breakfast was one of the best we have had at a hotel.
Our room was joined to another one by a internal door and it was very loud you could hear everything the guests did in the other room.
"location superb, Bar and buffet for meals fantastic"
"Pool was under maintenance and with daily temperatures well over 30 with close to 100% humidity this was poor as we were there 4 days, and still no sign of it being likely to be recommissioned soon....."
"Beautiful building and grounds.  Well taken care of.  Our room had a stunning view of  the Indian ocean.  It was comfortable and had character. Good facilities, including a nice pool.  Overall very charming."
Breakfast selection could have been better.
"Lonely planet guide implies service is not good, i found them excellent (but was low season)Amazing, historic hotel, nice pool, had a lovely massage (ask for Thai Gin)Amazing museum gallery of people who stayed thereGood locationWas scorchio when i was there an oasis in a sweltering city!!!!!Reception staff were very helpfull"
"I think with my booking.com discount the price was very good, but was low seasonAs in most places in Sri lanka factor in the 26% ""stealth taxes""!!!!!!"
Some facilities were still closed for renovation. They should be finished soon. Renovated rooms are very nice. They have taken great pains during the renovation to retain the historic character of the hotel.
"Very slow and cumbersome check in procedure, took 20 minutes."
"great location ,super service , fantastic old colonial building. nice large pool."
"not much choice of food,  no real beach to go to.  not good for children. basic rooms very small.you need to upgrade."
"Beautiful hotel overlooking the ocean.Many old pictures and artefacts.Upgraded to a suite which was extremely roomy and luxurious. Breakfasts were outstanding,dinner in 1864 and Buffet in Verandah also excellent.Great moment for a Scot to hear the bagpipes playing when the flag was taken down at 6 PM.- unbelievable!"
It was awesome stay in galle face. Really nice hotel. Over all staff is very good and caring. I was here only for one night. It was only bad feeling. I want more time to stay there. I am very disappointed just because i was wasted my 4 days in hotel galadari it was bad hotel. And hotel galle face was awesome.
"The hotel still retains some of the 'old' charm from a bygone era, although with mod cons. We seemed to get an upgrade, so our room was huge! Top floor, corner suite, and very well furnished. The pool area was great to watch the sun disappearing. The breakfast buffet was excellent, with lots of choice."
"Despite being on the top floor, our room was noisy until fairly late at night. The lift 'arrangements' are somewhat strange.....up in a lift, down a long corridor then up a flight of stairs to get to our room."
Location and the lobby
Poor service at the pool - over an hour to get a snack. Very few loungers at the pool. Check out confusion. Room not as described in Booking.com paperwork
Staff were great. Helpful and courteous. Everything I asked for was produced and their presentation was immaculatel.
A little slow with one meal at the travelers bar one night. Had to ask where my dessert was after a long wait.
Fabulous colonial era hotel.  Refurbishment now completed.  Fantastic location for this city.
Booking.com money transfer from GBP to USD to Sri Lankan Rupees was significantly diadvantageous on the bill!
A lovely old but modernised colonial hotel.  Breakfast in very nice outdoor restaurant overlooking the sea.  Staff are so friendly and helpful.  Very interesting to see photos of the many famous guests ...
Management have preserved a wonderfully British heritage by running an elegant and efficient establishment. It is a great pleasure to be a guest.
There truly was nothing at all to complain about. It rained a couple of days!
"Really nice rooms (had a junior suite but got upgraded to a suite). A special ""british colonies"" atmosphere that we only found in some indian hotels before.THE place to stay for a couple of nights in Colombo."
"May be the pool needs to be refreshed? Ask to stay in a renovated room, the old ones seem a bit outdated..."
"Beautiful historic buildingSunsets are really niceThe pool is ok"
"The room was very humid and smells of humidity which caused allergies and made it difficult to sleepThe staff is not friendly at all, especially compared to where we came from in TangalleThey also rarely understand what we were sayingThe hotel would not let us have a late check out supposedly because it was full that day. I was at the hotel all day and say very few people arrive, I am very confident they could have spared at least one room until 6pm, we had to wait for 5 hours without a room"
The hotel was lovely and the staff attentive. There was a lovely sunset.
The food was not great and we suffered from being there before and on Independence Day.
"This is the second time since January that we were enjoying Galle face hotel, I have no further comments.  We just like the hotel and will come back again."
It is a beautiful hotel which has maintained a wonderful colonial atmosphere and standard. It cannot be faulted in our eyes.
There was nothing to dislike. It really is a great hotel.
We stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms with balcony. Very comfortable.  The sun sets over the ocean each night perfect for cocktails by the pool bar - lovely service from the team there.
"The location beside Galle Face Green and close to the fort district, the great character of this great hotel with masses of space and first class service. The pool by the sea and the buffet breakfast. Everything works just right."
Beautiful hotel from 1864 with unique colonial character. Nicely situated by the sea which gives a nice sea breeze. Beautiful hotel rooms which are both spacious and nicely furnished. We had a wonderful terrace overlooking the saltwater pool. Many nice restaurants and very price worthy buffet for lunch and dinner. Definitely a place we would love to come back to if we have the chance!!
We liked everything
Beautiful location. Despite being a traditional hotel it has modernised very tastefully. the pool and leisure area was very safe and relaxing. Staff could not have been more friendly.
"Everything was clean except for the men's spa area, where the pools did not look well maintained."
"Lovely colonial style hotel, great buffet breakfast, very friendly staff. Free water and soft drinks in minibar very welcome. Good value cocktails at pool bar."
Room a bit small with limited storage for clothes. Door to adjoining room could limit privacy. Some parasols missing from pool area.
"The place as in overall is amazing, staff was very helpful and very friendly, The rooms are big , clean , comfy , facilities met my expectations, i would stay there again if i return back anytime. great experience overall and recommended."
As for my own experience i got nothing that bothered me during my stay.
"Everything about this hotel was amazing. Right from the llook and feel of the hotel (the palace feel), the surroundings, the staff, the breakfast, the wifi, eveything was top class."
Nothing.
It was clean & appealing to the eye
"I found the staff that manned the front desk a little rude, Very impersonal, didn't receive a welcome drink."
"Classic with class and a great pool.  Step back into history and enjoy luxury .  Enjoyed the veranda bar area with the sound of crashing surf.  A ""must visit"" as the grand old but carefully modernized colonial style hotel with fine traditions"
Should have more menu options instead buffets as there are few nearby restaurants.  Ocean bathing is prohibited.
"Beautiful building from days gone by. A real class hotel in a brilliant location with fantastic staff and a gorgeous classic room. Views at sunset were simply beautiful! The moment that we walked into the building we were treated so well! Staff also went the extra mile knowing it was our honeymoon which made the stay even more special. Also, we stayed over Christmas and was surprised to receive a chocolate santa in a stocking most mornings."
"Staying over Christmas meant that a lot of energy was put into the big day, but come Boxing Day, the staff were totally shattered (I don't blame them at all) and pretty much took their foot off the pedal. Was surprised at the breakfast buffet - quite disappointing! Egg hoppers were SO hard you could hear them snap. The guy at the egg station was all over the place every morning that we went there. Certainly room for improvement but it won't overshadow the wonderful experience of staying there!"
Hotel looks great. Rooms look great.
"The pool area stank of raw sewage, the staff in the bar were indifferent at best. The a la carte restuarant was overprieced, but nice enough. Between the sound of the aircon and the sea, we barely got any sleep. Don't get a seaview room, they're noisy and the windows are pretty small anyway."
The grandeur of the building and the location
Reception staff were hard work and check in was over-complicated. Had problem with final bill but eventually it was sorted out.
"The location and setting of the property was excellent. Th hotel has a very old world colonial feel to it, which is charming. Excellent for viewing sunsets."
The service was abysmall. The only factor pulling down this hotel is its service.
"The dimensions are palatial, and a welcome warmth from all the wood.  You will find things like libraries and wooden plank floors."
"Minor inconvenience: some air duct was causing vibrations in the wall, and ocean swimming is not allowed in that area."
"Loved the friendly staff, gorgeous rooms, stylish poolside and croquet! The food was also amazing and had fantastic views of the indian ocean. We were there on christmas day and particularly loved the decorations adorning the hotel, and the band playing during christmas lunch. The sunset scottish bagpipe player was also a lovely touch."
The pool area and our room seemed to take in some of the outside pollution (a sewerage smell) for a little while which I suspect came from whatever rubbish is being poured into the ocean. The smell eventually left our room but was constant near the pool area (less so if you sat on a sunbed closer to the outside bar).
The location was superb. It's an old hotel full of history but is very up to date. Absolutely stunning! The buffet evening meal and the breakfast were highlights of our trip.
Location by the sea and in town
That the price I had to pay was 25 % more than what booking.com quoted. I will not use booking.com again as your quotation did not include taxes and gave no indication of what these were. It would have been preferable to book directly with the hotel.
"The situation, especially the swimming pool, with the ocean waves crashing just feet below.  The historic feel to the place.  The view from our balcony room."
"The check-in experience - slow and cumbersome.  The buffet dining was expensive, and not that great."
"A classic hotel which only Asia can provide: old world character. Recently restored, the rooms and public areas are tasteful with great attention to detail. The food was excellent, all 3 buffet meals and the fabulous afternoon tea with scones and cucumber sandwiches. Excellent location and frankly amazing value for money at under $200 with a sea view room. (I am not sure one needs a sea view as most views, even of the courtyard are fine). We had no time to take advantage of the pool, spa, sauna, jacuzzi. The hotel museum is a nice touch and well worth a quick visit."
"Great location, fabulous view from the room, beautiful old hotel, great room service burgers."
"Room was not as luxurious as expected for the property, everything beige and muted. Extra taxes to pay (over 20%) not included in online room rate. Breakfast was extra on our deal and extremely poor quality (avoid unless you like a disappointing but expensive breakfast and a long queue for your omelette!), glad we only tried it once. Staff was just okay, not quite the high levels of service with a smile expected (I was expecting something like the Taj hotels)."
Location. Pool. Staff.
"Sauna is in very bad shape. No tourist information on display (Colombo has no attractions?!?). No tour/ travel agency offerings on display for comparison. I'm sure - one day, inshallah - noisy work around the hotel will be completed......."
Excellent location at the seafront. Colonial grandeur. Rich history. Very helpful and cheerful staff. The sounds of waves were amazing. Good reliable Wifi. Nice pool and spa.
None.
"Magnificent colonial hotelOn the ocean with lots of history.Breakfast fantasticGreat bars with views"
"We didn't get a room with a view  as requested."
"The location, the views and the history of the place was compelling and made for a very pleasant stay overall."
"Sadly, the service and attention one would usually equate with a 5-star hotel was not present. The large majority of staff were delightful and well-meaning, but seemed to be unfortatelely slow, the attention misplaced or they just didn't understand what was required."
"the view from the pool/bar is unbeatable! the breakfast buffet is amazing... food generally delicious, but not cheap!"
"we had a tiny, a bit noisy room towards the busy galle road."
"- The hot shower with very precise temperature controls.- The colonial architecture and history of the building"
The breakfast buffet was nothing to write home about....
"Sea view rooms make the experience. Other rooms are lovely and many are recently renovated, but seeing the ocean close up from one's bed (rather than a wall or nearby buildings) is worth the price hands down. The hotel is right on the sea (as close as one can be; there is no beach; just a sea wall), the staff are lovely and very accommodating, the food is very good, the location is in the heart of 'old Colombo' on Galle Face green, not far from the old Fort. The colonial ambience is charming (probably not to all ofcourse), there is a well-equipped gym, a spa and a salt-water pool, again, next to the sea. Wish I was still there!"
"Mostly loads of positives (see below!). Just a couple of other items: Though great deal of renovation has been completed, there seems to be a bit still underway so, some hammering during the day. Nothing too disturbing. Also - just FYI for management - we called the Hotel reservation desk directly and had a lengthy call trying to look into a booking.com reservation. Much of the call was honestly focusing on just trying to get my name fed back to me accurately, but then long silences. I had to enquire if the hotel reservations rep was still there. She was, but didn't seem sure what to say. After a few minutes, she finally said I need to call booking.com directly. Strange experience! Needs a bit of training and perhaps support in English language development. She was friendly though!"
The staff was very nice and helpfull. The hotel restaurant has an amazing view on the sea. The hotel is located in a nice area
The room we got was a little outdated and it had a terrible smell in the bathroom.
Great location. Lovely building. Fantastic food. Lovely friendly staff.
Noise from weddings but we were upgraded to larger room so it was dealt with well.
All would be great if the rates are cheaper when you consider you have to add mother 30% to the cost of the published rate
The extra tax and service charge make when you consider cost if the flights then you think .Spain
The hotel is marvellous. Wonderful building right on the sea front
Considering the price you pay for staying at this prestigious hotel the breakfast should be included in the price and there seen to be a lot of staff but still take and age to check in
"Location, building itself is great, nice service, friendly staff."
Room quite small. During visit reception moved causing some confusion and long walk to new reception.
Hotel staff were extremely helpful.  The hotel is in a great area where you can relax from the congestion and pace of the city.  I got sick while I was staying at the hotel and the hotel provided an excellent doctor who helped me recover.  The reception and staff were more than helpful during the entire stay and especially with providing room service while I was not feeling well.
Breakfast was very good but was not included with the rate.
"The location of this hotel is unbeatable, G&T on the big terrace by the ocean a must on any visit to Colombo. We took advantage of the food deal that came with the price and though we liked the lunch buffet, the dinner wasn't all that great and worth the price but it was convenient to just hang in the hotel for a day after a strenuous day of travel.The staff were friendly and the hotel oozes colonial atmosphere, though it's all polished and shiny now, not like it was when I first visited."
"The fact that the classic wing was closed for renovations, which reduced the hotel and our experience to only one side of the hotel. I had come here years ago and remembered the unique faded colonial atmosphere and had chosen to come again just for that. My mistake of course, I should have read the website more carefully and bad timing on my side."
"ServiceSuiteRoom serviceBeach bar"
The waterworks had waterhammer vibrations every time the WC was used. Aircon was too cold and had no thermostat control
Location was good
The room did not have enough lights. No newspapers were provided. Very old building and only one elevator. Overall I did not like and will not stay there again.
I loved the historic/heritage aspect of the hotel.
"Crows and chipmunks at the pool bar were annoying, but not something the hotel can really control.  Go at night and they won't be so bothersome!"
"Brilliant service! Not exactly a budget hotel but certainly delivers on all fronts. A problem at lunch was speedily resolved, the bill cancelled and what's more hotel manager came to our table at dinner to apologise and offer dinner on the house!"
No bad experiences.
"- Staff - were helpful & courteous - Food - especially room service- Facilities - pool and gym were brilliant"
- Wi-Fi although free was slow I'd expect better from such a good hotel in a city.
Nice views from some of the rooms.  Bar on the seafront is great. There is a refurbishment programme underway.  Free wifi and reasonably well equipped gym on site.
"Rooms looking a bit tired and sea view is interpreted fairly loosely.  Hotel car services are expensive, though efficient.  Spa area is large, but also a bit tired."
"Overall this is a very, very good hotel, boarding on a great hotel. A hotel where film stars, presidents and prime ministers have stayed. Dining room has photos of past famous guests."
"The electrical wiring was dodgy. Some power points worked, some didn't. Power went off to our room only for about 15 mins. Decor in dining room was not in keeping with the rest of the (colonial era) hotel. One wall had a hint of South American Aztec. But these are minor criticisms. It is a very good hotel."
"Great swimming pool, loungers overlooking the sea for the sunset, fantastic breakfast selection. Huge jacuzzi bath, colossal rooms, great location for walks along the front and a very handy shopping centre and food court across the road."
"The wifi in my ground floor room was an ongoing problem. In the end I had to rearrange the furniture to get a signal. Once I did that everything was fine, but then I had a desk across the bathroom door. Needs working on."
"Wonderful staff at a place that had everything you could imagine. Fantasticly service minded from the reception, to the restaurant and the pool bar. Great breakfast with lots of different choices and an amazingly comfy bed. Our flight wasn't until late so we could use the facilities in the spa during the night which was great. Also the guys who got you taxis and stored your bags were wonderful! Ten out of ten!!"
"Some of the pool guys stared a lot... Too much for working at a hotel that caters swimming pool and sunbeds. They should be used to girls in bikinis and respect that they don't someone to be staring at them while sunbathing (we were two sisters, this probably doesn't happen to couples)."
Excellent and personalized  service
"Apart from the excellent breakfast , the food served at the restaurant is quite poor in diversity and quality . Not at all at the high standard of the hotel and the service"
"My adult daughter and I spent one night and a late checkout day at the GFH at the end of our 2 week Sri Lankan trip.We loved everything about it!Staff VERY helpful, friendly, the breakfast super, the pool, the views, sunset, food and drinks at the Pool Bar. We had a deluxe room with an ocean view...just great!"
All excellent.
"We arrived extremely early but were allowed our room immediately. We did upgrade to a suite with a balcony- worth every extra dollar. we had 2 balconies overlooking the gardens and ocean. Wonderful. Loved the colonial charm, the hotel is beautifully maintained and loved the little museum. Would recommend room 2020 to couples and families."
Most rooms are without balconies although still well appointed and furnished.
"The dour faced accountant aside, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The location is great, the atmosphere historic and the food wonderful."
About two thirds of the hotel is currently under renovation. I especially regretted not being able to access the wide veranda overlooking the ocean. My room did not get much natural light which made it a bit dingy. The wifi was not strong which was a real nuisance when it came time to pay the bill by credit card as the hotel could not get acknowledgement from VISA and they were not going to allow me to walk out of there with just signing the chit.
"We upgraded to suite 2020, lovely room with 2 balconies overlooking the sea. Would recommend this room to couples or families as it had a separate tv area. The staff are welcoming and helpful. We arrived very early but no problems with going straight to our room. Loved the colonial feel and furnishings, extremely clean, loved the museum in the hotel. Poolside bar service great. Half of the hotel is being refurbished but it did not affect the running of the rest or the quality of our stay."
Nothing not to like.
"the swimming pool location is graetas well as the bar,rental cars of the hotel are expensive"
"not extra food in the meno, rental cars of the hotel, luxury"
Great colonial feel in the best position in Colombo. Excellent attentive service throughout the whole hotel. Older pool and outdoor areas but right on the ocean. Great food options especially breakfast.
Renovations that have been completed are in keeping with the style (and grace) of the hotel... staff are helpful and friendly... great location.
"Main part of the building is still being renovated, so much of the grandeur is yet to be unveiled. Not all the rooms in the renovated wing are of the same standard."
"The place has a feel of grandness, history and art. The moment you walk in, its breathtaking. The staff is absolutely wonderful with everyone giving you a smile and greetings."
"Superb view of Indian ocean from the room, jacuzzi in the room, spread of breakfast, champagne served with breakfast, the hotel museum, so impressive celebrity guest list."
nothing to dislike in this hotel
Excellent location next to the sea and Galle Face Green. An historic hotel with original features but sympathetically modernised. Large seawater pool and a bar and terrace to watch the sun go down. Pleasant and efficient staff. A large choice of dishes at breakfast.
The Wifi tended to come and go. There are more extras on the bill (service charges and taxes etc) than you get in Europe.
"Great room with spa bath in the middle of the room. Nice sea view. Fantastic breakfast buffet.Friendly staff."
Unfortunately the hotel was under renovation during our stay.
Perfect view. Great dinner! Very good breakfast for buffet. People are very nice and helpful.
The hot tub on our balcony was never addressed. I found out myself it was out of order.
"Lovely colonial atmosphere, great pool, friendly staff, our big room had spectacular view of the ocean, wonderful breakfast"
"Bad luck that the renovation was not finished, so the much appraised restaurants were closed"
The old colonial style of the hotel in a good location for downtown colombo. The room was spacious and very well appointed. Staff were very helpful and the food was good. Part of the hotel was being upgraded while we were there but it did not cause us any problems.
nothing
"Location, customer service, ambience"
"A very basic and disappointing curry in the restaurant, the hotel is rather overpriced for what it is. The wi-fi only works in the area near the reception"
"The exceptionally attentive staff. Not a detail missed, whether saying good morning or opening doors or ordering tuk tuks - we felt incredibly spoilt.The bed was very comfortable too!"
"Loved the gracious and elegant atmosphere. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. The breakfast selections were outstanding. The rooms were large with high ceilings, good air con and big bathtubs."
The hotel is undergoing extensive renovation to the north wing but the hotel is doing an excellent job blocking off the area and keeping the noise level unobtrusive.
"The staff were welcoming and treated every guest the same whether they were rich, business, backpacker etc. The pool and pool bar overlook the sea and are perfect for sunsets. The hotel is steeped in history and is a proper treat."
"Beautiful wooden floors mean if a running, jumping child is in the room above yours it's a bit noisy!"
"The staff are lovely, considerate people. They remember you from your previous visits!Excellent breakfast fare in1864!"
"The thought that they may jack their prices sky high on completion of the renovation!1864 can get a bit frantic with everyone seemingly breakfasting at the same time."
"The staff at the hotel were so friendly and helpful, great location and good food."
Tried to get a drink at 11.45pm to be told by reception it was fine but to be told we couldn't at the  pool  bar only to be served in a hurried slapdash way.  Price of spa treatments expensive.
"The huge renovation is coming to a close but I'm delighted that the hotel has retained its old colonial charm. Sadly the time-honoured ""meeter and greeter"" , aged in his nineties died very recently, but the  hotel retained his services to the very end. The hotel general manager was attentive and nothing seemed too much trouble. We look forward to our next visit once the renovation has been completed."
"Loved the generous breakfast, with fresh fruits and plenty of option. The swimming pool with stunning seaview is fab"
We asked for a room with seaview and didn't get one. The service at the pool bar is bad: the waiters favours outside guests from hotel guests (45min to get our orders)
"The service is good in the restaurant although a bit slow at the bar outside.  But you have to remember things are a bit slower in Sri Lanka... The staff are super helpful and always smiling.The food in the restaurant 1860 is exceptionally good as is the breakfast buffet.   Highly recommended.They have the best pool in Colombo (not the biggest but with the best views for the sunset)."
"The experience at the spa was disappointing.  The bed wasn't clean and the arrival to room wasn't smooth and the girl couldn't see that the bed still had oil on it from the previous customer.   I have been to the Galleface 3 times and this experience wasn't at all what I've experienced in previous trips.The new taxi service, run by BMW (!) was extremely disappointing and not to the standard I have experienced before.  Poor English, drivers didn't know where they were going and expensive. You're better off using Kangaroo Taxis. But if you want a nice car then I guess they're good for that.  The hotel car services were much better before and in keeping with the hotel."
"LocationGorgeous view and terrace with the Balcony Suite"
"2 power outages in the course of the night meant no A/C in our room and made for a restless night.After a week travelling around Sri Lanka this was the first place where we felt ill after visiting the restaurant."
Location and staff
The rooms were such a let down. The exterior teases with pomp and opulence until you get into the room which is basic at best. The biggest disappointment on our trip to SriLanka. Expecting Raffles and got Ibis.
"Lovely helpful staff. Rooms are very comfortable and well maintained. Food was good, though maybe a little expensive for what it was. Great location for sea and visiting attractions and shops. The old school colonial feel is abundant in all areas of the hotel. It manages to remain un corporate as many hotels now feel like business hotels in Colombo. On the whole a good choice of hotel to mark ones arrival in Sri Lanka."
"Shame that so much building work is going on, but that cannot be helped. Noise was at a minimum. Wifi could be intermittent but that is general to Sri Lanka."
The best place we stayed in Sri Lanka.
Price was definitely on the high end.
"wonderful staff, so well looked after. they really care for their guests."
Perfect place to stay in Colombo overlooking the ocean and away from the chaos
Service in Long Room excellent.
Property and staff was great
Room size was to small. Should mention room dimensions at booking stage
"Breakfast in the Verandah BarSalt water pool + pool barCocktails at the Travellers BarFriendly and efficient staffGrand and beautiful hotel"
"Room size (superior room)Old style furniture Buffet (dinner and breakfast)"
Whirlpool didn't work
A really pleasant experience in beautiful building with helpful staff
Our  room didn't have the view promised but we were moved the next day
We stayed in 5 hotels in Sri Lanka and this was the best one! Such a wonderful character.
All perfect
Beautiful location and fascinating historical building. The service was  elegant but not uncomfortable.
Lovely old hotel with a good range of eating options. Very easy to get around and find things.
Excellent service and a nice hotel right on the water.
You pay for the experience - possibly there are other options a bit cheaper in Colombo.
"Great place, location and facilities."
Request a non smoking room as some can be a little stinky.
Pool.  Choice of food.  Sea front location.  The building itself is stunning.
Room was not ready at check in time.
The beach front and the sunsets
The bold pool man who was rude and not helpful.
Good location and a beautiful property with a great view!
Terrible service and average food!
Absolute spoiling
Having to leave
Food was excellent!
Superior room with ocean view definitely didn't match our expectations though - very little view of the ocean!

No Balcony in the rooms and only one chair in the room.  Can hear the neighbouring room occupants.
"Great location, classic old hotel, extremely good service, great sunset views."
Loved the feel of the hotel and the friendliness of the staff
Had to wait 1 and half hour for burger to arrive at beachbar. No problems in restaurants
