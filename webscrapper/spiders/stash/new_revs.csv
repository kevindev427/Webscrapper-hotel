{"text": "The old colonial feeling. The whole buildings,  swimming pool, restaurants, the walk along the beach and hip vibe at night."}
{"text": "They don't have local cuisine that we wanted to have before leaving the country. The room is very small considering the value."}
{"text": "Loved this hotel! The staff couldn't have been more helpful or friendly. The breakfast was amazing - probably 1 of the best buffets I have had."}
{"text": "It was very quiet but this was because of the recent Easter Sunday bombings"}
{"text": "Loved the enormous salt water pool,, and the breakfasts , especially the freshly made hoppers\r I usually sat a little longer with an extra pot of chai overlooking the sea,, nothing was a problem. And brilliant front desk and concierge service"}
{"text": "Such a lovely stay at the hotel. We arrived just after the terrible news on Colombo and despite having army personnel around the hotel, the staff were so amazing at making us feel safe and at ease. As it was our honeymoon, the staff upgraded our room and sent bubbles and chocolates to our room which was a lovely touch. The room service was also so prompt and tasty. We\u2019re planning on returning in the future to spend more time here. Thank you to everyone at the Galle Face for being so lovely at a time of tragedy for Sri Lanka."}
{"text": "The breakfast was incredible, the staff beyond helpful and the bedrooms were lovely. It was a truly great stay and I would definitely stay again."}
{"text": "I don't have a bad word to say about the Galle Face Hotel, we loved every minute."}
{"text": "The history is amazing and the place is huge and beautifully presented. the pool is great and th eoptions for drinks and food are really good. Location is also perfect."}
{"text": "Nothing"}
{"text": "Staying here made for a wonderful first night in Sri Lanka. A gorgeous historic building that has been looked after so well. Lovely rooms, incredible evening buffet eaten under the stars, a fun Cuban bar on site to watch the sunset and a lovely clean pool. Wonderful location too!"}
{"text": "Nothing!"}
{"text": "Breakfast was very good and varied as would have been expected from a 5 star hotel. \rBed was comfortable\rPool was excellent overlooking the sea - lovely to relax and hear the waves lapping. \rStaff were incredible helpful and always willing to help even organising a taxi for us at the end for the airport. We did not use the hotel's cars which would have cost $70 to the airport and instead used  Kangroo Cabs which cost 3000 rupees."}
{"text": "For what we paid, I was expecting a nicer room. Although we got one of the cheapest rooms, we still paid \u00a3165 a night for a basic room and breakfast - with a view over a unused courtyard and building which had paint peeling off its walls. \r We had stayed in much nicer rooms throughout our stay, but I understand that you are paying for the location and to stay in a piece of history. \rOne night we went to the hotels Cuban restaurant, My partner is vegan and even though vegan options were given, the food was bland and tasteless and we ended up spending \u00a328 for 4 small plates and 2 mock-tails. I would not recommend eating there!"}
{"text": "Beautiful colonial hotel close to the seafront. Wonderfully restored to its former beauty. Great spacious and well-appointed rooms, excellent breakfast and dinner. Superlative staff with great service!"}
{"text": "Perhaps a little pricy, but worth it."}
{"text": "An amazing place to stay in Colombo- friendly staff, incredible food, plenty of history to enjoy in a place that oozes style and takes you back in time.  Definitely recommend it!"}

{"text": "Rooms are old but well mantained. Could use an update. We had a balcony and what we could see: another building..."}
{"text": "This place is a living heritage museum, celebrating bygone eras. Staying here is a must on your visit to Sri Lanka. The building is beautiful and classic, the service friendly and helpful, the food and drinks delicious. I strongly recommend having sundowner drinks in the courtyard and watching the bagpiper play as the Sri Lankan flag is lowered at sunset - what a remarkable experience!"}
{"text": "The hotel is an iconic place. So much history! En joy the historic tour of the hotel to get the best historic insight of the property."}
{"text": "Pity the harbour and big buildings are coming towards the hotel..."}
{"text": "A wonderful hotel in every sense enhanced by fantastic staff. Colonial style with grand staircases and wood panelling. Staying here is a unique experience. There are plenty of marble palaces nearby but once inside you could be in any city in the world. The Galle Face Hotel is Colombo."}
{"text": "Nothing to dislike."}
{"text": "The staff. The welcome and check in process. Having complimentary minibar items and welcome snacks. The happy hour snacks were delicious. The ocean view from the room along with the sound of waves crashing on the property's beach. The outside seating area of the restaurants by the beach. The suite size. The TV was big."}
{"text": "The hotel is old but not in a charming way. It looks like it needs renovation. The carpets need replacement (they look dirty), the wood needs polishing and the wall needs painting. Some areas of the hotel smelled like sewers and some of the towels in the toilet looked so worn out."}
{"text": "The hotel is very colonial - it literally breathes the history of older times. It is truly one of the main places to see in Colombo, we highly recommend it for a stay in the city. We stayed for one night on our way back home and we really regreted not staying there longer.\rThe staff are AMAZING - welcoming, helpful, discreet. You truly feel the luxury and the tradition of quality. This hotel is a city within a city - there are so many things you can do - 4 amazing restaurants, splendid front line sea view pool with salt water, bars with an exciting selection of drinks, spa area, museum (how crazy is that?!:)), wime cellar.. \rSpecial thanks to the manager who gave us an upgrade and a complimentary early check-in. \rWe were surprised that the hotel managed to overcome our expectations! Will definitely stay again."}
{"text": "I liked the food. The burger was excellent on the veranda. We also went to the 1864 French restaurant and the steaks were very good. Service was impeccable and all in all a great experience and end to our holiday."}
{"text": "Curtains weren\u2019t quite fitting the windows which was annoying in the morning."}
{"text": "Huge room and you can hear the waves when you open the windows. Great breakfast and iconic sunset"}
{"text": "The hotel is a bit tired and our room looked like t hadn\u2019t been used in a while. The staff was very quick in fixing it, but We let we had better experience in significantly cheaper places."}
{"text": "Old colonial hotel with memories of days gone by!"}
{"text": "Our room was in a wing on the side, however the passage was noisy with people walking and we could hear doors banging! It is a beautiful old quaint colonial hotel, as such the floor creek etc"}
{"text": "Have stayed here many times. The hotel has refurbished and improved consistently over the years. I can't imagine staying somewhere else in Colombo."}
{"text": "The room was great the staff was friendly and professional. We had high tea with invited friends rather than dinner which was fantastic.\n"}
{"text": "Nothing. Everything was perfect."}
{"text": "Nice, big hotel with history. Beautiful terrace to enjoy a drink. Breakfast was vast and lovely. Nice pool overlooking the ocean."}
{"text": "Our room was okay but not as beautiful as where we stayed before here. "}

{"text": "If you can fault this hotel in any way I\u2019d be utterly surprised. "}
{"text": "Everything about this beautiful hotel is perfect. The staff are wonderful. The breakfast is superb and the atmosphere/buildings are excellent. I will always return here when I come back to Colombo!"}
{"text": "The location right on the water is stunning.  It was lovely to sit by the pool and overlook the ocean and have the waves crashing right there.  It doesn't get much more beautiful than this.  It is also very close to any restaurant or site you want to visit in Colombo.  The buffet breakfast was also quite delicious.  The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay."}
{"text": "Galla Face is a total refuge from the chaos that is Columbo. Lovely setting and sunset views, kind and very attentive staff, very good food - breakfast will be an abiding memory of our trip. The hotel is old school elegance and calm. It\u2019s a big place but never feels frenetic or over busy. You feel slightly like you\u2019re in an episode of Jewel in the Crown - a real experience and we were delighted to top and tail our Sri Lanka trip here."}
{"text": "Honestly, not a thing."}
{"text": "Liked the always helpful staff. The location was excellent\rTheir Fine dinning restaurant was superb"}
{"text": "NOISE....late night loud Thump Thump music from lower floor ...which made me angry as on booking I specified a quiet room ..the hotel replied and said for my 3 night stay I would have a quiet room...it wasn\u2019t quiet at all. Buffet restaurant needs an overhaul on food selection and presentation."}
{"text": "Really enjoyed our stay. The amount of food to choose from in the buffet was amazing. Staff very helpful and friendly. Room was good and pool area very nice."}
{"text": "A room with a balcony would have been nice but overall good"}
{"text": "The hotel was everything i expected. I was there for the Ironman race and i was welcomed the minute i stepped in the door despite turning up with my bike and all my kit. The rooms are great. The hotel is steeped in history and this is reflected in every aspect of the place. I would highly recommend it when you are in Colombo. I fell asleep to the sound of the sea!!"}
{"text": "nothing, i loved it"}
{"text": "Location, swimming pool, atmospheric old colonial hotel, with a wonderful museum over the history of the hotel. The sunset, the lowering of the Sri Lankan flag at sunset."}
{"text": "It was a very different experience of living in old colonial hotel on the coast of a bustling city of Colombo.  I did not have too much opportunity to explore the city (I only saw if from the window of the car going to work), instead I took the time to explore the hotel itself and it was an adventure.  For those of you who enjoy historical places, this hotel has a lot to offer!  It is worth to talk to the staff members about the history of the place an some slightly quirky rituals that the guests will surely witness :).   Even if the hotel itself is over 150 years old, it offeres all modern facilities.  I greatly appreciated the fact that the rooms are equipped with old-fashioned ceiling fans as well as the air conditioning.   This way I had a choice not to use the later and still stay cool in the room.  The breakfast buffet is excellent with a large choice of diverse dishes - both local, Western and also some Oriental.   Overally it is a good hotel for those, who want to stay in a place which is differnet from the modern Western style business hotels."}
{"text": "Beautiful old colonial hotels. Great facilities, lovely big pool. Nice pool bar and Cuban restaurant. Drinks quite pricey compared to other hotels we stayed at in Sri Lanka.\nHuge bedroom."}
{"text": "Silly light system all controlled from a key pad that you can\u2019t see in the night! Difficult to find a light switch to actually turn on! Air con was also difficult to use and so our room hot overnight."}
{"text": "The ambience of the historic past, the building, the rooms, the location - all great"}
{"text": "Many groups of tourists, and the fact that the hotel misses a few \u2018younger\u2019 propositions - Cuban bar a good start... terrace area, long room can do with more of the same.... how can you make the hotel more interesting for younger  clientele?!\n"}
{"text": "Again an old colonial style hotel . Rooms we stayed in were tired and a bit rough around the edges, I believe they are in the process of updating the rooms.\rWith tax and service charge added on , prices for drinks, spa treatments and food were similar to western hotel prices. Nice salt water pool.Pool bar area good for watching sunsets, Sri Lankan piper announces sunset , and sri lankan flag  lowered overnight.\rGood breakfast buffets."}
{"text": "Some mildew and fungus on wood in bathroom ,  manager told us  he would move us, but hotel full . Didn\"t here any more from him and remained in same room. However they did scrape above off the wood !"}
{"text": "There was a fantastic welcome as we arrived in the morning the staff went out of their way to get our room ready earlier so we didn't have to wait until check in. Everyone was very friendly and provided fantastic customer service, nothing was too much trouble. Thank you for making the start of my holiday in Sri Lanka one to remember."}
{"text": "With a short notice, the hotel arrange to send me a vehicle to the airport to pick me up."}
{"text": "In the check-in, the staff in the front desk assigned me  a room which is less than what I paid for.\rUpon bringing this issue to management, I was giving the right one."}
{"text": "Swimming pool and restaurants The Verandah and the Cuban by the sea"}
{"text": "Room was on 4th floor in one corner facing a tower with a soldier with weapon. It was big but old, bathroom had a leak. Old room old aisle."}
{"text": "Fantastic historic hotel. First class accommodation.  Pillows / bed great. View of property & ocean sensational. Breakfast buffet very nice.  Staff plentiful. Pool excellent.  Cheap tuk tuk to markets or shops in Colombo."}
{"text": "Can\u2019t think of any."}
{"text": "On the seafront but unable to swim in the sea.  Very efficient and friendly staff. Ok location. Access to many local hotel restaurants.  Complementary soft drinks and snacksin the room fridge. Hotel Cuban bar lively with good cocktails. 30m swimming pool with salt water. Spa and gym facilities good."}
{"text": "No view from our room. Lots of building projects nearby, but this did not affect our hotel stay."}
{"text": "Colonial grandeur - a delight to stay in this beautiful heritage building with such a rich history. Gin and tonic on the beachfront, a swim in the pool and a Sri Lankan curry buffet for dinner. Heaven! I never opened a door the whole time I stayed there. Staff were very attentive and friendly."}
{"text": "There was not a single thing to complain about."}
{"text": "The staff were great, nothing was a problem. The breakfast is fantastic. The pool is clean and amazing spot for watching the sunset "}
{"text": "The lunch wasn\u2019t great "}
{"text": "A historical and traditional hotel, beautiful place and wondelful property. The renovation is made very well, they have not destroyed the feeling of the palace. The room was big and well equipped. The staff is professional. We got very good dinners in the special restaurants and the selection of wines is huge."}
{"text": "We had to wait more than half an hour before we got the room even that we arrived after 2 in the afternoon. They just forgot us sitting on the sofa. The buffetrestaurant is too big and restless, it was not nice to have at least breakfast there."}
{"text": "We were very impressed with the check-in service. We arrived slightly early and were able to check-in after a short wait. The hotel is beautiful, in a perfect sea-front location and feels like stepping back into a long-gone colonial era. The room (junior suite) was beautifully appointed with two sea-view balconies, a feature jacuzzi bath and very comfortable bed."}
{"text": "Unfortunately we were disappointed by the restaurant experience. We were staying at the hotel to mark a special occasion and I had made a dinner reservation at the Verandah at the time of booking. Upon arriving at the restaurant we were informed that it was buffet only that night (no a la carte) due to a private function in another restaurant. I felt the hotel could have communicated this at the time of booking, which would have given me the opportunity to make alternative arrangements. It also created issues for bathroom use as the usual bathrooms were off limits due to the private function, so we had to go up to L1 for the bathroom, which caused a further inconvenience to us and was disruptive to our special dinner. I felt the hotel prioritized the private function at the expense of other guests' experience, and I have to say this is not what I expected from this hotel. In addition, the buffet itself was not great, so what was supposed to be a special evening was a disappointment."}
{"text": "Love the location by the sea. Friendly staff. Amazing breakfast buffet.  Great massage at the spa."}
{"text": "Was offered a rubbish room with noisy road outside. I was upgraded after a little time so it worked out ok in the end."}
{"text": "This beautiful, stylish hotel had no faults in my opinion; the restaurants and bars are diverse and excellent, the staff are charming and helpful, the building is magnificent  and even the small museum (housing, aming other things The Duke of Edinburgh's first ever car!). The museum also lists some of the previous guests at the hotel, including Cole Porter, Mark Twain, Noel Coward, Laurenve Olivier, Duke Ellington and Scarlett Johansson.  There's not much to be said for Colombo, so it's just as well that you feel like hanging around the hotel all day!"}
{"text": "We came in late desk duty were very curtious and efficient, bell staff were the same and then on top of that we were upgraded to a sea view suite wonderful way to wake up in the morning.\rThankyou"}
{"text": "Old colonial style atmosphere. Bedroom comfortable and beautiful."}
{"text": "No view whatsoever from bedroom.\rSlow service in bar area during lunch time. Quality of food served during the various buffet services and the seating ambiance of the restaurant could be much better."}
{"text": "Despite being a large hotel the staff still make it feel very friendly. The fact that the hotel has its own seafront and has retained its sense of its history makes it feel quite special.  The hotel catering was excellent."}
{"text": "The best hotel in Colombo, and probably in all  Sri Lanka\nColonial atmosphere,  perfect service, and excellent breakfast"}
{"text": "Cost much more than the alternatives"}
{"text": "The bathroom was perfect, the room very comfortable, even had views. The pool and pool area was wonderful."}
{"text": "Breakfast not included. Otherwise there was nothing to not like!"}
{"text": "Airport pick up service was excellent.  Beautiful breakfast on the veranda. Tried the Siri Lankan specialities.   Had great tea with pastries."}
{"text": "Our stay was to short."}
{"text": "This hotel is over 150 years old and it is well reflected in the overal ambience.  For travellers who like hotels with the difference, it is a very pleasant experience.   Even a tour around the hotel is like sightseeing.   I also liked the location.  Right by the sea [althought the beach is not large], a great position to watch sunsets.  It is also close to a busy city promenade where you can immerse yourself in Colombo's life, so different from the slightly posh atmosphere of the hotel.\rBreakfast it very good.  A wide range - local and European food.  Very fresh and tasty.  Meals are served on the verandah which allows to feel the warmth and sea breeze.   Hotel has few bars, including a latino bar with life music.  The rooms have fans as well as air conditioners.  Fans are bit noisy sometimes, but for those who can't stand air conditioning this is a good alternative.  Staff is very helpful and patient.  Like everywhere in Sri Lanka.  Overall, definitely a very pleasant experience."}
{"text": "Sometimes I felt I was getting too much attention.   But this is just a cultural difference :)"}
{"text": "Beautiful historical hotel that has been well maintained. The location, staff, facilities (especially the pool) were all fantastic and deserving of the 5 star rating. Thank you for such a wonderful stay. "}
{"text": "Nothing! "}
{"text": "Galle Face Hotel is one of the iconic hotels of the past and lives up to its reputation. Compares to Raffles, Eastern & Oriental and Peninsular hotels."}
{"text": "My only criticism is that Colombo itself does not provide enough interest to support a lengthy stay at the hotel."}
{"text": "Everything you\u2019d expect to find in an historic hotel like this. Staff amazing, great facilities, room well presented and restaurants/bar good too. Enjoyed our stay!"}
{"text": "Unfortunately some ants had made there way into the mini bar, but this was quickly rectified by house keeping and the contents replaced (so not really an issue). "}
{"text": "I\u2019m struggling to think of positives. The hotel was ok, nothing special stands out."}
{"text": "The waiting staff were sometimes attentive and other times completely ignored you. It was really hit and miss. We stayed in 8 other hotels during our tour of Sri Lanka and experienced far better service elsewhere.\nThe food is overpriced and mediocre. Again we had much better food elsewhere on our Sri Lankan travels for less than half the price.\nThe pool is small for a hotel of this size and there are not enough sun beds.\nThe room appeared clean at first glance, but look again and you can see that the rug hadn\u2019t been hovered etc.\nWe could also hear noises from outside which disturbed our sleep.\nWe will look to book elsewhere next time we are in Colombo and I would advise you do the same. I couldn\u2019t recommend this hotel."}
{"text": "Great location by the water, equipped with a gym, spa and pool.  Love the Veranda area! Love the breakfast spread! Service with a smile! "}
{"text": "If staying during the week of national day beware of parade and celebrations that result in road blocks in the morning til lunch time.  If you arrange for driver I find they themselves along with hotel do lot know how bad traffic will be or when Road will clear."}
{"text": "Very grand hotel. Historical features still in place. Good selection of bars and restaurants on site. Nice pool size which was not over crowded. Staff were attentive and well mannered."}
{"text": "Noise from room above very loud due to wooden flooring and furniture if moved above and also noise in corridor travels very far. Room was small, basic and in need of a touch up especially considering the grandeur of the hotel."}
{"text": "This is an historic and elegant hotel which is fully updated while retaining much of its historic character. It is in a stunning position right on the coast.  The staff are plentiful and accommodating, food is good and there are a number of restaurants to choose from, breakfast was an extensive buffet featuring european and Sri Lankan dishes.  We used the hotel three times as a base in Colombo on our trip and would use it again"}
{"text": "One of the rooms we stayed in, while having great views, was situated above a bar which played music late at night.  On the plus side, when we complained to the management about our disturbed night, they acted promptly to ensure that we were given a quiet room for our next night at the hotel."}
{"text": "Very good breakfast buffet. Helpful smiling staff. Good location. Easy to get passing taxis and tuk tuks. Interesting little museum with Prince Phillip's car. Attractive general areas."}

{"text": "floor boards were creaking :) it was charming for us, not sure about the neighbors on the below floor!"}
{"text": "Fantastic old hotel in excellent location. Comfortable bed in lovely large room. Overall the hotel seems caught between being an axclusive first class hotel and a mass market offer. Loved the sea views and the history of the place. Sense of fading grandeur."}
{"text": "Air conditioning in room could not be adjusted. Very noisy and much too cold. Bathroom ok but in need if upgrade to be first class. The hotel falls between premier and mass market. It would need an upgrade to be the former but is too expensive to work as the latter."}

{"text": "Since last year I feel it had gone down hill . They kindly upgraded my room so no complaints but glad only there one night as view over back and roof tops and room nothing to pontificate about , so no major advantage ,whereas before I had a view over sea, front and Galle face green. Also little things like soap dish chipped in bathroom, lighting not great. Breakfast buffet deteriorated , choice more limited and had run out of emmental cheese which one doesn\u2019t expect of hotel of this calibre No idea about dinner buffet . Dined at Cuban restaurant instead but sad seaspray had gone. Overall seems a bit scruffy compared to my previous stays."}
{"text": "The ambience of this place and the attention to detail was extraordinary. The Royal Dutch suite was truly luxurious with views over the water, and the complimentary chocolates to recognise wedding anniversary, as well as upgrade to access pre-dinner champagne and canapes in the Long Room, while watching a beautiful sunset was truly memorable. The swimming pool and pool service was second to none. The Library is well worth a visit too. Wished we could have stayed longer..."}

{"text": "Paid for a deluxe queen room. Room was small,view of a dirty ally-way,and showed its age.,"}
{"text": "Colonial history, design and location. Cuban restaurant was excellent and great fun with excellent staff"}
{"text": "The evening we were there there was a major corporate event which dominated the main ding area and bar area. The majority of the terrace was closed to residents and the music was over bearing and far too intrusive.\rIt is quite simply that paying guest enjoyment should be compromised in this way. We should have been warned and the room rate reduced as we were unable to use all the facilities advertised and the event took over the whole outside area.\rThe outside bar area lacks atmosphere and just doesn't feel right when it should be brilliant. More thought is needed on the detail to create a truly colonial feel.\rI do not think buffet service for Dinner in the main terrace restaurant is what one expects of a international hotel. Bit like being at a Club Med resort."}
{"text": "We had a wonderful stay in the Galle Face during pre-christmas time. A fantastic feeling in the traditional house. Scenic view, friendly staff and beautiful colonial style decoration. Love it!"}
{"text": "The room was a bit oldish decorated for such a traditional house it is a pitty. The food was average, with a bit too much Sri Lankan taste."}
{"text": "The location of the landmark hotel is brilliant. as well as the history. The management is there poor. Rather uncomfortable for the lady travellers. No personal touch, no guest relation appointed managers we met. no welcome we have experienced. as much as we regret."}

{"text": "The old world charm but still new looking."}
{"text": "I booked through booking.com. Reception somehow missed that I had alreadypaid for 2 of the 3 rooms I\u2019d booked and accidentally charged twice for one room. This could have easily been avoided if record keeping was done well. There was unnecessary hassle caused at check out."}
{"text": "Gorgeous heritage property thar takes you back in time. Delightfully luxurious as well and stunning location."}

{"text": "Fabulous location and a very comfortable and stylish hotel.  Works as a place to relax as well as visit the city."}
{"text": "The reception desk were a bit unwelcoming - it was sunset and the hotel has a tradition of 'piping' down the sun which is fun to view.  Our receptionist messed around and never said 'welcome' and we pretty much missed it.  Poor training for a hotel of such quality, but I stress that wasnt true of all the reception staff."}
{"text": "Location - you can walk nearly to every landmark in the city. \nThe swimming pool nearly at the beach. \nChoice of restaurants and bars (yet the speed of service could be improved, especiallly at King of the Mambo!)\nFriendly and helpfull staff!\nYou should try the spa offer, especially the massage (ask for firm tratment and leave really relaxed)"}
{"text": "Room was rather loud, mainly due to not sound proofed doors, with a lot of noises coming from the corridor - source were guests but also housekeeping employees, active early morning (6-8 AM) - we couldn\u2019t sleep well\nBad smell as a result of humidity (in the room and some of the public spaces)\nThe price of airport pick-up / drop-off servcie is above average (even comparing to the Blacklane package of comparable car standard)"}
{"text": "Location is very central and unique as the garden is directly on the seafront (most other main hotels are separated by the main road). The swimming pool is spacious (40 m) & uses sea water.

{"text": "Has so much potential to be a great hotel. However the building is run down, customer service staff have very little concept on what they are doing and at times rude and unhelpful. Food selection in restaurants was poor. Seems to cater for a primarily middle age British holiday maker demographic with pre purchased holiday packages.\rAlso had an awful experience with some missing jewellery that had been delivered for us from another hotel. Galle Face have refused to accept any responsibility for this despite it going missing whilst in their care. We will pursuing this legally."}

If they\u2019d told me that 8 months in advance I would have cancelled the booking.  Ended up being a disaster of a two night stay and they didn\u2019t seem to care at all.  Rooms are old and tired with archaic control systems.  Staff were nice but service was agonisingly slow even by Sri Lankan standards.  Terrible value for money compared to other hotels in the city, you\u2019re paying for the history of the place more than anything else."}
{"text": "For historians a delight this old and famous hotel. Some of the rituals (such as an unusual ceremony every sunset) were very enjoyable."}
{"text": "The rooms' bathroom needed some maintenance, but upon return to the hotel some days later all were very apologetic and a free upgrade was granted."}
{"text": "The colonial charm of the hotel and its location overlooking the ocean, which was perfect for watching sunsets. Also, the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. A bonus was the quality and variety of food served at the buffets."}

{"text": "Noise. Wooden floors and noisy people in the room upstairs meant I was woken at 1.15am on the first night and a party until 2.30am on the second night led to bad nights sleep. The spa was a bit disorganised and deep tissue massage was not deep tissue and not very good. \nAvoid if you want to sleep. I checked out a day early and management response was pretty poor. "}
{"text": "As hotels around the world slowly become indistinguishable from each other this hotel is unique full of surprises and as helpful and friendly as you can be. I loved it and I'm coming back."}

{"text": "Nothing really. Parts of the hotel exterior need a bit of TLC "}
{"text": "This hotel truly lives up to its reputation as the finest hotel east of the suez. We checked in last minute, as an addition to our honeymoon travels and we were so glad we did! Amazing location, decor, staff, facilities and food. Would definitely recommend the Galle Face to anyone travelling in Sri Lanka."}
{"text": "The building is fantastic. The hotel has really that classic stylish look.\nRooms are clean.\nBreakfast is excellent."}
{"text": "There is many staff around, however they\u2019re not that focused on service and creating that special atmosphere. Eg waiting times for checking in and out are much too long.\nThe area around the hotel is dramatically changing.\nHotel is slightly overpriced for what you really get. It\u2019s not that special experience I hoped to get."}
{"text": "Staff were very friendly but not overly helpful. Swimming pool was amazing. The pool bar is also great for snacks and drinks almost any time of day. \nThe building itself is just gorgeous. The galle face green is right next door and is a great spot to take in a sunset and sea breeze. \nThe fort district is only a short walk and there is a shopping mall across the road. "}
{"text": "The room wasn't as clean as it could have been. A pair of false eyelashes left in the shower were waiting for us the first time we used it. \nWe called reception three times for assistance we never did receive. \nPrice gouging when leaving. Don't ask for a taxi they will provide the hotel car for more than double the price of an actual taxi. Take an uber using the hotels Wi-Fi instead. "}
{"text": "The whole hotel is an experience from beginning to end. Just walking around this beautiful hotel is like sight seeing in museum.  Their traditions such as the 6 oclock piper from the hotel to the shore, the two weddings we were lucky enough to watch.  All perfect.  Just one little problem.  The door between rooms (locked) did nothing to stop the noise next door.  We could hear teaspoons clinking, conversations, etc.  Luckily for us we had two considerate neighbours.  Not sure how that noise could be reduced.  Guess next time I would definitely ask for a room with no shared door.  However this is a beautiful hotel , on an amazing point of land in Colombo so make sure to go there (and ask for a room without door)"}
{"text": "Only the shared door probem"}
{"text": "We returned to this fabulous colonial oasis after 36 years and it was more wonderful than before. The hotel is charming and is a reminder of a bygone era.  The staff are very much up to date about the importance of friendly, efficient service and are able to communicate extremely well with travellers from all over the world. A smile goes a long way and there are certainly many of those from the hotel staff.  The restaurants, bar, pool, museum and grounds are top notch and make for a very romantic interlude in a very busy city.  My husband and I highly recommend The Galle Face Hotel."}

{"text": "Nothing, I am always satisfied with the best"}
{"text": "We were placed in an (upgraded) room above thumping music that kept us awake. 'Just till 11.30pm' we were told when we called reception. Appalling at these prices! We had to demand a change of room in the middle of the night - very inconvenient. Never again!"}
{"text": "Well preserved colonial relic "}
{"text": "F&B staff at buffet area needs to be more proactive; the young trainees at Reception desk need better training and improve on their customer service attitude "}

So many others I dont have the names. they create awesome experiences for guests !"}

{"text": "the hotel is the best place I have ever stayed at - the view from the room, the hoppers for breakfast and the sunset on the patio are incomparable - thanks"}
{"text": "This is a fantastic hotel for a splurge. Yes, there are more affordable hotels in Colombo, but you need a night here to experience all the Dutch colonial charm. The staff were so accommodating, great rooms, amazing food and a wonderful experience."}
{"text": "This hotel is full of old world charm and the experience was fantastic.  The staff throughout and very helpful and pleasant.  Great location.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text": "The room was a bit small.  We had an ocean view room with balcony but the cushions on the outside chairs were filled with rain water and there were no towels to use the outside lounges (though they soon arrived when requested).  The fridge did not work very well."}
{"text": "The hotel was in a great location and had a lot of charm,  The staff were great - especially those who welcomed us on our arrival at 3am!"}
{"text": "Just outside the door to our room were all the spare beds/mattresses.  This was not a good look."}
{"text": "Beautiful property which is built ON the beach, so you can hear the waves from almost everywhere in the hotel. So it gives you an unmatched resort vibe while still being located in the heart of Colombo city. They have preserved the grand heritage of the hotel very appropriately, we stayed in a 42 Sq.m junior suite with a huge private balcony facing the ocean. It doesn\u2019t get better than that."}
{"text": "The staff were a little lazy. People didn\u2019t offer to help with luggage on both instances which was very surprising to me. The food also was acceptable but not a smack out of the park as one would have expected at a big 5 star in Colombo. Afternoon high tea at the veranda must be the most beautiful tea spot in Colombo. However the tea choices were disgraceful. Air conditioning in the room could have been a little more powerful, I suspect like most hotels they reduced the airflow between 2-5am."}
{"text": "What can one say about the Galleface Hotel that has not being previously said. This is an exceptional hotel and everything about it oozes five star. It should be on every traveller's itinerary to spend at least a couple of days at this hotel. We will be back."}
{"text": "Breakfast. "}
{"text": "The room was very small and bathroom doors had problem. Not value for money. Had stayed here earlier, was given a better room. Not idle for old people and people on wheel chairs. "}
{"text": "Great spot great pool and nice bar and restaurant "}
{"text": "Not really value for the money you pay compared to other places. Concierge service not overly helpful"}
{"text": "Balcony suite was wonderful & breakfasts excellent. Nanna wonderful breakfast manager"}
{"text": "External paintwork was in a poor state especially front of building. Selection of drinks at happy hour in long bar was poor. If you are going to have a happy hour then make it a real happy hour otherwise I would have preferred to see the piping of the flag down at the main bar downstairs. Small front beach contained a lot of plastic litter that should be the responsibility of the pool attendant to clear every day. I picked up a lot but without a bin in sight all I could do was inappropriately give it to the breakfast bar attendant."}
{"text": "Wonderful old colonial charm to the hotel! Staff was friendly and accommodating and the food was delicious! They even surprised us with champagne in our room for our honeymoon!"}
{"text": "The superior style rooms have very thin walls so you can hear everything in the next room."}
{"text": "The hotel staff were verry attentive. Great pool. The rooms very comfortable and the daily breakfast second to none. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone."}
{"text": "Stay at this hotel for a sense of grandeur and history. It feels a little like going back in time, in a good way. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite, which was about the size of a London flat, and very comfortable. Everything was polite and professional."}
{"text": "No complaints."}
{"text": "Excellent location. Spacious rooms. We were upgraded to junior suite. Had a seaview and view of pool deck. There is so much history and tradition at this hotel. The small museum is a must visit. There is also tours of the hotel on certain days. "}
{"text": "Nothing not to like. Staff at the Verandah restaurant were so helpful but we ate at pool restaurant one night and found the staff unhelpful. They need to up their game to match the other areas of the hotel."}
{"text": "Great room with a view, we were upgraded and also had a cake waiting in our room as it was my birthday. This was a very kind touch which was much appreciated.good location to have a drink and watch the sunset as well.\rBeautifully preserved features in the hotel, classic compared to many of the more bland modern hotels nearby."}
{"text": "There was an event taking place on the chequerboard/area in front of the bar/restaurant and by the beach the night we stayed. We were not informed of this in advance or when we checked in and you could hear everything through the windows as our room overlooked it. That would have been ok as it finished reasonably early but the crew then started  to dismantle all of the props and metal structures that were in place for it. They woke us around 12.30 with the noise from doing this as they took no care to do this quietly. They continued doing this until after 2.30 am (I don\u2019t know when it stopped!) as I eventually fell asleep then (with ear plugs on!). I didn\u2019t ring down as I kept thinking that surely the hotel staff would see and hear what was going on. Also, they obviously wanted them to dismantle it that night rather than next morning so I don\u2019t think calling down would have made any difference as I doubt it would have been stopped just for us. It seems such an odd thing to do at that time of night in the first instance. If we had been informed in advance of this event, I would have asked for a different room.\rWhen we checked out, we weren\u2019t asked how everything was but I did bring this up and the manager was called. They were very apologetic and offered an upgrade if we stayed again but couldn\u2019t do that as we said we were leaving Colombo. They then gave us 2 bottles of water..\rIt was a shame as it is a lovely hotel but due to being older, there is capacity for a lot of noise through the windows and under doors at night. I would perhaps return if I was in Colombo but not anywhere near the busier parts of the hotel and I do not think it is worth some of the rates that were quoted on booking.com (we got it last minute for c\u00a3100 which was ok). We stayed in Paradise Road Tintagel the 2 nights before and found it much more relaxing, calm and very professional staff."}

{"text": "The coffee was not good. "}
{"text": "Beautiful colonial hotel; we stayed in a Junior Suite with an ocean view balcony, absolutely magnificent room. We ate in the 1864 restaurant and the meal was faultless. Thoroughly enjoyable 48 hour relax at the end of our holiday - we\u2019ll be back one day. "}
{"text": "Faultless but a word of warning - we were able to book an airport taxi for \u00a34K (local currency) less than the hotel service offered - look locally!"}
{"text": "Beautiful building with fabulous salt water swimming pool and views out to sea.\rLovely room with view over the Green. Good breakfast."}
{"text": "I was asked on way out if I was checking out because I did not come from reception desk. It was not a pleasant ending"}
{"text": "Location was good."}
{"text": "The staff were not very attentive. Very inconsistent with training as there seemed to be no standard. The staff did not wear their uniform with pride.  I choose the hotel based on its history and location. I expected the staff to be better. Hotel interior needs a good refurb. I would not recommend to others as there are many better close by."}

You can spend hours in the coffeeshop looking at the sea!!!\nMine was a short stay so i cannot comment on the food but looked like a huge spread .Excellent staff. Very caring. I fell down outside the hotel and was hurt. Quick medication and manager himself came to see me and called few hours later to ask if i needed anything. Bellboy   smiled in greeting when he came to pick up my bags even   as early as  2.30 am  in the morning."}
{"text": "There was nothing not to like.."}
{"text": "We were upgraded, so possibly not the most objective review, but the hotel itself is just beautiful, with the colonial architecture preserved and accentuated. The staff we excellent and the food (we only had breakfast buffet) very good."}
{"text": "The pool is sea water. It's warm though."}
{"text": "The hotel has a great atmosphere - really takes you back in time. Also level of service is very high. Great romantic place for a couple"}
{"text": "N/A - we had fantastic time"}
{"text": "The staff at the reception is very rude and non-professional. But I only had bad experience with one staff. Other staffs at the hotel is very helpful. The hotel is has easy access to supermarket, shopping center and beach. Jewelry store is worth to visit. The breakfast at the hotel is good."}
{"text": "Customer service. The hotel is old,  needs renovation."}
{"text": "the hotel is amazing and walking in its big rooms and corridors reacalls you all the past of the hotel and its prestige. The room was big, confortable and very clean. The mini frigo was included with a lot of local products that we enjoyed either for the taste and as well for promoting national products. The staff was really carefull and nice altought they had lot of work as the hotel was full of people. The swimming pool was very big and the sun beds very confortable. We did not used the restaurant as we thought it was a bit overpriced if you compare with other options in nearby first class hotels and in any case that night menu was with international food and we prefered a more local option. But still it was very good looking."}
{"text": "Is a bit difficult to find something that was not as we expected. Of course the price is a bit high for being in Sri Lanka, but it is still cheap exspecially if you think back to your country where a luxury hotel would cost half of my salary per night. We also used the pick up service at the airport that  was kind and professional but I found out that many agencies provide it 40/45 % cheaper."}
{"text": "This hotel is a true gem. A historic hotel with ample charm and character , all brought upto date for a modern stay. Although there are many luxury 5* hotels popping up near Galle Face I couldn\u2019t imagine missing the opportunity to stay here."}

Even on Booking.com.\nAfter I guaranteed by credit card (Non-refundable) the hotel & Booking.com said the fare excluded 30% of extra tax.\nEven the dinning menu or In room dining everything is charged with 30% extra without mentioning. This is frustrating. "}
{"text": "The overall ambience, location of the property, staff courtesy , house keeping is of good quality.\rThe hotel is a very old hotel , has good history and is very well kept. The staff is mix of young and senior employees who are very friendly and happy to assist any time."}
{"text": "There is nothing i can say i did not like."}
{"text": "This hotel is an absolute gem, one of the best in Asia. The look is classy and has kept its old charm but modernised the experience. Amazing staff are accommodating and the view of the sea is fantastic."}
{"text": "Nothing!!"}
{"text": "Hotel very old and made of wood so there are a lot of insects. Breakfast is the same everyday (staying there for 5 days). Staff chatting very loudly in corridor, impolite when answering phone call, and purposely avoid opening door. There is no washroom door separating from bedroom so it's very cold when taking shower due to aircon from the other. Soundproof is very low (wall is not made by concrete - tested after knocking). In room dinning options is very limited. To make the matter worse, the food quality is very bad."}
{"text": "a perfect hotel which takes you back in time  to the british colonial era.\rA beach facing hotel , old style building adds class.\rvery helpful staff and comfortable stay,"}
{"text": "na"}
{"text": "The age, history and beauty of the place are clear. In its time and even today there is a certain opulence you don\u2019t get with a modern hotel. The staff are all incredibly friendly and helpful. The room is tastefully appointed and the bathroom had a beautiful hot shower with plenty of space. The bar staff near the pool were exceptionally helpful and kind, also they make fantastic cocktails. Sitting ocean side in the evening while the waves crash against the ocean wall with the warm breeze is magic."}
{"text": "The room I was in had an ant infestation. I mentioned it to the staff who told me it was an old building. I think the language barrier may have been a problem but I had ants all through my bed. If I put food down for two minutes sure enough the ants would swarm the plate. This made me very uncomfortable the first night but I forgot about it the second and third. Due to the age of the building and wooden floors the wood creaks and groans. The large doors at the ends of the corridors bang loudly and I could hear people talking in rooms far down the corridor or coughing at night. These little things are nothing more than an annoyance but it does lend to the age and beauty of the building."}
{"text": "Huge room, great bathroom & shower, and the breakfast/lounge/bar areas looking out onto the sea front are brilliant places to spend time any hour of the day.\rParticular favourite was bagpipes at the flag raising/lowering"}
{"text": "Beautiful old hotel with a rich and interesting history which has bee very well refurbished.\rWe loved looking out at the sea and it has a good pool area."}
{"text": "The room was pokey ,too small with suitcases and only a place for 1 case. \rOur room was on the main Galle Face Road so rather noisy though it quietend down in the middle of the night.\rPlease watch out for the local touts who pounced on us as soon as we left the hotel on foot claiming to be a member of staff and wanting to help us cross the road. We were exhausted and did not pick up on cues that we both felt we would have on a normal day\rDo not use tuk tuks in Colombo just get the hotel to arrange a taxi.\rMaybe we just were unlucky but our day was expensive and unpleasant.....\rHappy to say we have met nothing but kindness since leaving Colombo!!"}
{"text": "The Galle Face is a hotel full of charm and old colonial style with period furnishings but up to date facilities. The staff were all so friendly and polite and we absolutely loved staying there and would love to stay again. Breakfast was probably the best one that we have ever had  - the buffet had everything that you could wish for! At sundown complimentary cocktails were served on the seafront with canapes and a 'Beating the Retreat' ceremony by the Sri Lankan pipes and drums - simply fantastic!"}
{"text": "Nothing!"}
{"text": "The staff were lovely, particularly the reception staff. Friendly, helpful, warm. The setting is beautiful also, just if they could tidy up around the edges it would be even better again!"}
{"text": "The hotel may be a heritage hotel, but that doesn't preclude good maintenance and regular updating of fittings! The food at the bar is also very bad, warmed up frozen food. Gym is embarrassingly small for this grade of hotel."}
{"text": "Location, clean, good food, no pests, great laundry service"}
{"text": "The bathroom flooded every time the shower was used & everytime we got it dried it was never fully dry"}
{"text": "Beautiful, old fashion style hotel - like something out of a 1940's movie. Location makes it easy to move around Colombo. Can eat in the hotel at the restaurants close to the beach listening to the waves from the ocean crash into the sand/rocks."}
{"text": "Room was tiny and lacked space for a business traveller (even with an upgrade). There was a fruit bowl and chocolates left in my room (nice gesture) but ants had attacked and this resulted in ants roaming around the room on the desk, in-and-out of my laptop. Condensation problems in this hotel means clothes hung in room do not dry, but rather seem to get more damp with moisture, even with air conditioning switched on. Wi-Fi was exceptionally poor in my room. Almost unusable so I just gave up which was frustrating as my stay was for business. Gym is nice but way too small and lacks modern day equipment e.g. only 2 treadmills meaning a wait time which is inconvenient."}
{"text": "I always stay here in Columbo. I like the staff, the views of the Indian Ocean, the location and the furnishings, but most of all the beautiful building itself and the sense of colonial history. I also like the pool and pool area on the edge of the ocean and - sometimes- glorious sunsets."}

(Cleaning Staff's)\nManagement issued us a letter saying that certain things are complimentary and on discount, but restaurant staff's are not aware about it. \nPerson who came to check the mini bar was really rude, he ask the reason in delay in opening our room door.\nLinen were too old, look faded.\n"}
{"text": "Such history!  The interiors are incredible.  Location is perfect."}
{"text": "Im not a fan of Buffet style eating, otherwise this hotel is amazing.  There is another fancier restaurant though to dine at.  Despite that, I would still stay at this hotel again."}
{"text": "Old world charm with modern elegance.  Staff were helpful, friendly and were more than happy to assist you in any way. Emanuel, the concierge, was passionate about the manner in which he approached his job. His assistance was invaluable."}
{"text": "The Galle Face was terrific... Its position and history and old world charm. The rooms were massive, I'm sure we were upgraded to a suite - we had the best balcony (and I will miss the resident crow!)"}
{"text": "One badly booked meal (fish) on one occasion at the pool bar."}
{"text": "The breakfast was very good and the buffet dinner excellent.Not enough choice during lunch.The staff were extremely helpful to arrange all the needs"}
{"text": "The first room we were given as an upgrade  was not in good decorative order and had a big bathtub in the middle of the room, which means it is not an upgrade in the old wing which needs to be reburshed."}
{"text": "The colonial style building and central location "}
{"text": "Our 3 teenage kids arrived into Colombo at midnight. It was 2am before they arrived to the hotel. Although we had already checked them in there was no bedding or towels for the 3rd person. I think a bit more attention to detail is important "}
{"text": "Location"}
{"text": "Went with the family. We got overcharged by the hotel. Staff and managers are horrible and they try to trick you once u check in and offer a free upgrade but then u realise that it was not free. Food is really bad. Rooms wr full of insects and ants, but they changed our room. Carpets inside the room are too old and stinky. And all that was fr 300$ per day. Never again."}
{"text": "The Galle Face Hotel is a colonial heritage masterpiece filled with all manner of colonial charm and ambience.  The 30m salt water pool was wonderful as I like to swim 2kms every day."}
{"text": "The cost of the driver from airport to hotel was very expensive.  The people that assist with external excursions didn't appear to be all that keen or willing to make much of an effort to provide assistance."}
{"text": "Lovely Colonial hotel, great setting overlooking the ocean, a number of nice bars/restaurants in the hotel and friendly staff. Room was spacious and clean."}
{"text": "The room was very comfortable for our first night in Sri Lanka. The hotel is beautiful, colonial style, with lots of 'hidden' gems (we stumbled across a museum storing Prince Philip's first car!). Service was excellent both at check in/out and in the seafood restaurant. Food was amazing too, very fresh and reasonably priced. Pool was clean and pool staff friendly/helpful in bringing towels, mats and drinks. Highly recommend if you have a night or two in Colombo."}
{"text": "Nice outlook"}
{"text": "The crows that flew around the property and into the restaurant, staff could have made a better effort to reduce their interaction with guest experience."}
{"text": "The fudge on arrival! Big pool and a lovely choppy sea view."}
{"text": "Front desk staff - ignored us when we first arrived and then didn\u2019t feel the need to say we\u2019d left sunglasses on the counter when we checked out. We were in a tuktuk before we realised and came back and the glasses were still sat there. There\u2019s so many staff in the reception. \rAlso the man managing the pool literally pulled sunbed mats from under people at the mere flicker of rain. They got wet when people swam so a little OTT."}
{"text": "I read a few reviews saying this place was a bit tired and shabby. That must have been before a makeover because it's stunning now. The spa is the best quality that you would find in London and the rooms are really beautiful. Great food and cocktails and not particularly expensive. The room is significantly more expensive than most places in Colombo but it's definitely worth it. You won't find this kind of old glamour anywhere else."}
{"text": "We checked out a lot of Colonial Hotels during our Sri Lankan holiday and this one tops them all. Staff were so friendly and accommodating, my room had a lovely view of the sea, huge bath, the outdoor salt water pool was fabulous, and they even have bagpipes playing to take down the flag at dusk. Don\u2019t miss the chance to stay, absolutely a holiday highlight!"}
{"text": "Service tax not included and not really clear until the bill comes. Otherwise no issues at all!"}
{"text": "The hotel is gorgeous, especially the newly renovated rooms. The second floor has amazing large balconies, great for evening drinks. The restaurants were also very good. All the staff were amazingly helpful and lovely, responding positively for all our requests. will be certainly staying there again on my next visit to Colombo."}
{"text": "Room service can be a tiny bit slow sometimes. But if you're one a balcony enjoying the view, it doesn't matter much."}
{"text": "As described, the atmosphere and the breath of history is really impressive. The staff, especially at reception really friendly, helpful and very polite, top \ud83d\udc4d"}
{"text": "I really cannot say, what I disliked. It is an amazing, huge hotel, where you can breathe history, kind of hotels, I usually like more, then these super modern hotels. Staff, especially at reception was extremely friendly and helpful, sure top class. But leaving the hotel, there was missing this wow effect, wanting to stay another night."}
{"text": "Wished we had stayed longer to fully experience what the hotel had to offer. The building itself, and the staff were amazing. Bed SO comfy! Sadly we didn't get to have breakfast :("}
{"text": "That we weren't there long enough!"}
{"text": "Location is excelllent, rooms are clean and nice "}
{"text": "Staff was impolite, room allocation was horrible, with two infants they made me change 3 rooms before the room that i had booked was alloted, happy hours manger was very rude and bad behaviour."}
{"text": "This place is an absolute gem and completely worth the money - it will really make your stay in Colombo very special. From the beautiful rooms, variety of restaurants and gorgeous pool, this was an excellent hotel. I highly recommend it."}
{"text": "I had my wedding ceremony at the hotel and they went out of their way to make sure that the weather didn't dent our celebrations! excellent customer service and very friendly staff. The oldest/prestigious hotel in Sri Lanka gave the best service which is on par with the industry."}
{"text": "If you like the movie Casablanca you will love the famous Galle Face hotel. The staff, service, and food are delightfully elegant in an old world way. The building and grounds are magnificent. We enjoyed the spa which is well run and clean. The food is one half English style and half Indian-Sri Lankan. The outdoor restaurant is sooo pleasant. The room was airy and spacious. Complimentary snacks and fantastic room service. Loved the experience."}
{"text": "We\u2019re sorry we had to leave."}
{"text": "Beautiful colonial style hotel great location... We were there on a Buddhist holiday w/e with wonderful festivities and lights around the city but no alcohol served anywhere when we were dying for a G and T by The Indian Ocean at sunset .. Which is why you stay at Galle Face!"}
{"text": "The GFH was stunning in every aspect, the food, rooms, pool. There is such a grand old-world feeling to this hotel. We loved everything about our stay."}
{"text": "Staff were really friendly and helpful. We got a tour booked for Sigiriya and Dambulla and it was really nice organized."}
{"text": "This hotel is not worth the money. It is really expensive for what you actually get. The room is not that big, it has just a tiny window facing some houses roofs. It was really humid, all the clothes in the bag got wet due to the humidity and the beds felt like they were wet as well. Tv quality on the room was really poor, double image, pixeled... the shower wasn\u2019t great either. Really close to the wall which will make all the water get out of the bathtub while you shower. The room controls (lights) were like 30 year old. Overall experience wasn\u2019t great. Considering the amount of money we paid, we\u2019re not happy with the results."}
{"text": "We only stayed overnight after flying in to Colombo.\rThe hotel was well kept overall.\rThe staff were friendly and attentive. \rThe room was a good size as was the bathroom. We had a nice view of the bay.\rThe breakfast was substantial."}
{"text": "The bathroom had a fair few cracks and could've been a bit cleaner."}
{"text": "View was divine .. room great service excellent .. we loved the buffet and Seaspray restaurant.. we will look forward to coming back soon and wish we could have stayed longer"}
{"text": "Beautiful traditionsl historic hotel, so much Old Ceylon charm! Great bed pillows. Nice staff.loved the museum and the Travellers bar."}
{"text": "The restaurants charge a fortune..we went to the seafood restaurant expecting top seafood, we had a cold shared seafood dish -  but it was tasteless and small quantity, service was poor had to ask several times for the waiter to come over...we were really disapointed.  Bed was also uncomfortable but pillows were great."}
{"text": "I was only like the location"}
{"text": "In the name of Gall Face I thought its one of the best place to stay in Sri Lanka, Finally I have realized that I have made the wrong choice. I would not recommend to anyone this hotel anymore and I will never go there again.\rI was there with my family for a short stay and I was totally disappointed about the food and the services that we were received, I paid about AUD500 Per day, but its not worth what I paid.\rSpecially, there's nothing to eat in the buffet, most of them are empty, also, labels are  incorrect,  there are many issues which I could not wright here. And it's not good for the star hotel like this. hence its effect to the reputation of the hotel and to the Country.\rThanks"}
{"text": "The view was great to enjoy your breakfast on the veranda. The food and service at breakfast was wonderful. Meal in the fine dining restaurant was just perfect. \rStaff very friendly, informative and helpful."}
{"text": "Difficult to get to room on 4 floor, very confusing. \rVery dark in  bathroom to get ready, no natural light. Room on road side so a little noisy. Air con only effective if on high all night.\rHit and miss depending on the room you get i think!"}
{"text": "Beautiful rooms with view on the sea \nIncredible location and amazing atmosphere \nGot upgraded to an amazing suite "}
{"text": "Slow wifi \nBad reception on the tv "}
{"text": "Excellent breakfast, gorgeous views from the terrace. The pool was lovely. Generally the hotel is an oasis of tranquillity to escape noisy Colombo!"}
{"text": "Room had a slight drain smell."}
{"text": "Amazing location...couldn\u2019t ask for anything better. "}
{"text": "Food variety could be improved. If they don\u2019t have enough occupancy they don\u2019t serve buffet breakfast or dinner."}
{"text": "This hotel has the best position in Colombo with a wonderful seawater pool right on the beach.  It has been sympathetically renovated with very comfortable rooms but still retains a nostalgic grandeur."}
{"text": "This was our second stay at Galle Face Hotel. It's full of old-world charm, the service is excellent, and the food at 1864 is delicious. The spa is far better than it was two years ago. Overall, a great experience. We'll definitely stay here again."}
{"text": "The breakfast could've been better. While some items were very good, others were rather bad. It's a bit of a hit and miss."}
{"text": "Staff were fantastic helpful and friendly. The breakfast and themed dinner buffet was excellent. The spa was amazing. I would recommend this hotel to others."}
{"text": "Location and people Good , Breakfast Excellent and Chef was so co operative to support for Pure Veg Food and Guided us."}
{"text": "Carpet very dirty , In Room too much ants .Though they know I am handicapped having walking problem they provided room is south block which far away from lobby and breakfast area"}
{"text": "The location was great and the building beautiful"}
{"text": "I was told that I would have a sea view but was put in the back by the linen storage cupboard!  Food in the bar was truely terrible - samosas that were cold and rubbery and also a club sandwich made with stale dry bread.   Overall a disappointment. \rSome style but very little substance."}
{"text": "Location is great. Hotel is iconic and well preserved.\rNice museum."}
{"text": "There is no beach.\rVery small pool.\rCrowd invade the dinning area near the pool once food is served. N Ed\u2019s to be addressed by management."}
{"text": "Always a great place to stay in Colombo had a sea view room , breakfast was very good and as ALWYS the staff super helpful and friendly"}
{"text": "Towels in room a little worn and no complimentary water at the pool as in previous visits"}
{"text": "This is a beautiful historic hotel that has some amazing features to it. We loved the museum and the restaurant, we also sat out at the seaside bar and had a late coffee, it was a wonderful location. "}
{"text": "Amazing location, very nice hotel. The buffet was one of the best I\u2019ve tried with an excellent price and variety. The hotel is well maintained. The staff are friendly, I had a problem with the WiFi and they took care of it in a few mins. Excellent place to stay. I asked them for a cake for a celebration and they had it in the room right on time. I definitely recommend it. "}
{"text": "We returned to this hotel to recapture a treasured memory after having our first meal in Colombo there when we honeymooned in Sri Lanka 6 years ago.\rThey kindly gave us a room with a sea view.  It is a grand old hotel and the buffets are to die for. We had breakfast both days. The swimming pool overlooking the ocean is great. The staff were very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text": "The rooms are in need of a bit of TLC. Although we love the authentic vintage of this hotel, a little bit of sprucing up in the bedroom and bathroom would make a world of difference. \rIt is expensive to stay here and the cost of food and drinks matches this.  We knew that when we booked so that\u2019s ok."}
{"text": "The food in the restaurant was excellent and there was a good choice. The saltwater pool was large and deep, and warm!"}
{"text": "The room was not in good condition - it felt tired and some maintenance was needed on the towel rack in the bathroom. The smell from the drains was very noticeable.  \rMore significantly, and what really ruins the hotel, is that the staff attitude to guests was poor, with an air of self-importance which shouldn\u2019t be present in such an expensive establishment.  The staff on the pool bar were lax and more interested in chatting with each other than serving. Very disappointing."}
{"text": "Loved the property - beds were very comfortable, rooms were clean, staff very friendly and knowledgeable, enjoyed the 'club' room, salt water pool was nice. Would definitely recommend this to others - especially if they like historical things - restoration is beautiful."}
{"text": "Have no complaints."}
{"text": "Beautiful building and classic location. The wedding receptions are pageants."}
{"text": "Synthetic - or, at least, blends - towels in the bathroom - which did not absorb water - and synthetic serviettes in the restaurant. Resupply of the room was a bit erratic. Food was okay, but not great."}
{"text": "Great location and really nice staff and wonderful ambience!"}
{"text": "Could have been more chairs in the room. Only one. Or other places to put clothes. Bad towels."}
{"text": "Wow, from the moment you walk into Galle Face Hotel you know that you are in for a good stay. An incredible old building in immaculate condition with friendly staff and great facilities."}
{"text": "Helpfulness if staff. Celebration day on 15/4 was lots of fun with drummers, dances & games. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Chef Brian was cheerful & happy to explain all about Sri Lankan foods."}
{"text": "Making a mistake - my partner & I both accidentally made a booking each. The hotel upgraded \ud83e\udd17us one night at our request but no cancellation \u2639\ufe0f"}
{"text": "Owners did a great job of maintaining the history and heritage of the property, while also providing modern comfort. There are small niggles (minor fit and finish issues, leisurely response to some requests) - but would recommend to take it as part of the charm. The gentleman hired to scare off crows with a slingshot outside the breakfast place is a remarkable anachronism."}
{"text": "Request to set up an extra bed took half an hour and a reminder before it got done. There were minor imperfections in the room (slightly askew hole covering the ceiling, rattling bathroom fittings)."}
{"text": "To be honest: We read a lot about it and were a bit sceptical but the Galle Face hotel surpassed our expectations!\nBeautiful wooden floors, breathing history in every corner, very friendly and helpful staff, located right by the Indian Ocean, amazing breakfast, clean and well air conditioned rooms, very nice and long saltwater outdoor pool!\nLike we said in the title: A perfect place to stay your first few days when you arrive in Sri Lanka"}
{"text": "Only negative point is that from the hotel you have to look at the Harbour being build opposite the hotel ruining your view!"}
{"text": "Excellent staff; the breakfasts were lovely and the rooms extremely comfortable and well appointed. The pool was fantastic and loved the location at the far end of the Galle Face Green. Made for a pleasant stroll into the Fort area. I had trouble checking in for flights on my mobile and was able to use their business centre to do so and print my boarding passes. The common areas are also very beautiful, you can really feel the history in the hotel without it being run down. Room service was excellent in quality and delivery."}
{"text": "My experience in the spa was horrible (that being said, my sisters was fantastic and they did offer me 15% off my service based on the feedback they asked for right after the treatment, even though I didn't ask for any compensation). \rI found the buffet dinners at the Verandah the two nights we went (Japanese and Indian) to be OK but overpriced for what they were. Unless you are a big eater, I would go with a la carte."}
{"text": "The staff were extremely helpful. I liked the free minibar despite no alcohol in it. I loved the building the history and the museum. It had some great pictures throughout the hotel. It was a great last hotel of our holiday. We were treated very well."}
{"text": "View of the docks and ufgly buildings that now surround it."}
{"text": "Location & ambience"}
{"text": "Financial discipline. I was charged double for my room. A pre authentication of $ 250 was excess charged to my credit card instead of cancellation of the pre authentication.\rThis is unexpected for a booking through Booking.com. We will lose confidence on the site if this continues."}
{"text": "Local Sri Lankan food at Dinner and Breakfast was excellent."}
{"text": "Unfortunately not the best place for a woman travelling alone. Before 8 am in the morning, a male staff member unlocked and entered my room while I was in the bathroom. After I spoke out, he quickly backtracked and I confronted him in the hallway outside to query his presence in my room. His excuse was to do my laundry, which had not been requested, and why would that require room entry anyway? Next, during breakfast in the Ladies Washroom downstairs of the bar area, a male staff member stood grinning in the doorway as I came out of a cubicle to follow me (dressed modestly in long sleeves and long skirt) to the stairs making suggestive remarks. Although the Hotel Manager expressed concern about the incidents, sadly I will not consider to stay again alone in this place."}
{"text": "This is the only place to stay in Colombo. Directly on the beach in an iconic area. The hotel has had a magnificent make over. Old world charm overlain with everything that you would expect from a 5* hotel nowadays. Lovely wooden floors and large, well equipped spacious rooms. The hotel staff were lovely and very helpful. The food was excellent and the most amazing breakfast. The salt water swimming pool was a treat and watching the sunset in the grounds and the piper piping down the flag at the same time was a treat."}
{"text": "Nothing"}
{"text": "Lovely old hotel with lots of charm. I would stay here again for a day or two en route somewhere else in Sri Lanka, as this is (in my view) a transit hotel not a holiday location due to no beach. Ask for room 2044!"}
{"text": "Reception and check-in staff. Delayed our check-in by 30 mins and tried to put us in a room that was lower than the standard we had paid for. This started our stay with a bad feeling about the hotel. Staff are good but could be better."}
{"text": "The breakfast was the best I had in Sri Lanka. Nice big room."}
{"text": "Very expensive. For this price they should include an airport shuttle at least. Also the hotel taxi driver overcharged me for a very short journey. Avoid them and use the tuk tuks."}
{"text": "This a great old colonial property, essentially modernized, with a convenient setting in the center of the city.  The facilities were beautiful and well-maintained.  We stayed in the premier balcony rooms and enjoyed a spectacular view, a comfortable room, and access to an open-bar happy hour."}
{"text": "This is not a perfect 5 star top-class hotel; the staff can be a little erratic, and the rooms have some wildlife and history despite their refits.  If you expect 5+ star perfection, this may not not for you, but if you have a little patience and enjoy some quirk with your heritage, it's a wonderful place."}
{"text": "The breakfast buffet is fabulous and the attention to detail by the front office staff and concierge is wonderful."}
{"text": "The service in the Traveller's Bar was chaotic. wrong drinks delivered, drinks missing.  Needs attention."}
{"text": "Loved it. We got a good rate so perhaps not the best room so we didn\u2019t have a balcony (which is hard with young kids) but hat was our mistake! Museum, library and pool all great facilities. Also absolutely loved the fine dining restaurant bar"}
{"text": "Location and hotel are amazing. Graceful colonial building in original style. Hotel is adjacent to Gale Green and walking distance to Dutch hospital shopping area. On site food is good and reasonably priced."}
{"text": "Service is hit and miss. To give an example (could give more) ordering a cab at the reception was a painful undertaking where I was sent by reception, to concierge, to an empty taxi stand to a porter who sent me back to reception where I was asked to call myself. Typically upmarket hotels can\u2019t arrange a taxi for their guest. Not here (unless you take the overpriced hotel taxi)."}
{"text": "The hotel has been beautifully brought up to date keeping the gentle ambience and features of the old hotel, combined with the comforts of modern living. Everything you need and more. Staff were efficient and very friendly - nothing was too much trouble. "}
{"text": "The only thing wrong was that we didn\u2019t stay long enough. "}
{"text": "Fantastic historical hotel, renovated not too long ago. Beautiful building with very nice historical details. Great service and very good restaurant. The bar outside is amazing with sea view. Favorite hotel in Colombo"}
{"text": "Beautiful heritage building near the ocean"}
{"text": "Small room. Poor wifi which kept getting disconnected, mould in the bathroom edges, air conditioning died in the middle of the night. \rwake up call late by 30minutes!"}
{"text": "My wife and I were treated like royalty!  Every detail was properly taken care of with excellence."}
{"text": "I see my settings on Booking.com must be wrong.  I am an American, but this review states that I an Sri Lankan!  Never mind who I am, the stay was exceptional."}
{"text": "The hotel is run with efficiency and professionalism geared towards the comfort of guests.  The rooms are spacious and well-serviced and the staff strike the right balance between attentiveness and respect for your personal space."}
{"text": "The menu at the restaurant would benefit from the inclusion of more sophisticated dishes in both Sri Lankan and European cuisine."}
{"text": "The staff were wonderful in particular Kumar who looked after us in the long room. The swimming pool was well run and staff were accommodating in trying to find you a space at busy times. The gym although small did the job and the personal trainer there was a gentlemen. House keeping staff were friendly and accommodating also. Overall I was very impressed and I would definitely stay here again."}
{"text": "I didn\u2019t dislike anything"}
{"text": "Beautiful and recently refurbished hotel. Excellent location, food and good service. One of a kind really. "}
{"text": "Arrogant and condescending front desk staff. Extremely unhelpful during check in and reluctant to give a warm welcome. When asked to extend stay they said this was only possible at a fee of 380 USD which is a shame as later that day we got notifications of booking.com offering rooms at 100 USD. This really gave a negative twist to our overall stay.\nThe fact you cannot pull up in a tuk tuk is ridiculous. This is Sri Lanka and not Monaco - please get a grip. \nWith the ongoing real estate project on the west side of the hotel the view will soon be that of any major city and thus be ruined. I think the atmosphere the hotel boasts will be totally gone as Colombo is getting to ready to be the next Dubai."}
{"text": "The hotel has a wonderful history and is located very well."}
{"text": "The windows on the side of our room were filthy. The blinds were pulled down on that side and the cleaners ignored the windows behind, like for years. The bath was also not clean and when you turned on the jets, loads of black gunk came out. \rThe staff were generally quite snooty and were not overly keen to provide good service.\rIn general the hotel is a little tired and very over priced."}
{"text": "Staff was very friendly and prompt supporting (especially Mr.Manoj). I travel once a yr to Colombo for biz, this is the 1st time to Galle Face and for me it has the best compromise quality/price."}
{"text": "The hotel has a rustic feel to it, it has character, and at the same time provides all the modern facilities. Right on the sea, views are great."}
{"text": "service in the restaurant was not always efficient, waiting to be serviced"}
{"text": "We always stay there. Everything works, the food id great, the position unrivalled, and you can't beat the retro-Imperial chic of the Real Thing. Also, the gym's been fixed with new kit."}
{"text": "Nothing"}
{"text": "Beachfront, colonial charm."}
{"text": "Surly staff, the only hotel we stayed at where the welcome was indifferent. When the power failed 0630 as we were leaving, we dressed in the dark and were unable to use hairdryer, manager said it was my fault for not having reported it, despite it being quite inappropriate for a workman to be in our ( 2 females ) room as we were dressing and packing for an early airport departure. no apology. Poor service, no hand towels or dryers in the hotel loos."}
{"text": "For our final stop in Sri Lanka we chose to stay in a nice room in a nice hotel and picked the Galle Face Hotel.  We had a junior suite with a private balcony and lovely spa bathtub.  It came with breakfast and free happy hour drinks (which we sadly couldn't take as much advantage of as we would have liked).  Not a cheap place to stay, but very luxurious and would have been nice to stay another night or two.  We were delighted to find the hotel had a library - and amused to discover the museum.  It is a charming colonial hotel and the most formal place we stayed at in Sri Lanka."}
{"text": "Many coastal places have seagulls - Galle Face Hotel has crows and they will steal the food off your plate if you're not careful!  They also went after my hair a couple of times.  One of the restaurants has someone employed to shoo them off with a laser pointer which was somewhat effective.  Occasionally the air conditioning was a little fierce."}
{"text": "Was a lovely stay the staff were lovely particularly Shiraz on reception he was very very helpful\rLooking forward to returning again soon. Bedroom was lovely, excellent shower and very comfy beds.  The breakfast choice was exceptional"}
{"text": "We liked everything"}
{"text": "Location is by far the best among all other hotels in Colombo."}
{"text": "Interior of the room is old could have been updated.  I am sure there are better rooms at higher prices.  However, there are far better and newer hotels with better services are available at better prices.  This hotel is betting on the past fame than the actual current state of the hotel."}
{"text": "Watching the sunset from the bar and the piper piping down the flag is very moving.  Hotel has teal style.  Great free mini barwell stocked.  Comfy bed very relaxing"}
{"text": "The Agatha Christie atmosphere, location, food, staff come from another world, unfortunately passed away..."}
{"text": "Who cares ?\r...you don't want it to be perfect.."}
{"text": "I stayed at GF twice. The first time I was lucky to be upgraded to a suite, where i was lulled to sleep to the sound of crashing waves.  The second time was in a beautiful room too.  I enjoyed leisurely buffet breakfasts......so many choices. thank you."}
{"text": "Another very enjoyable stay at the GF. Love the old world charm and the packed breakfast box kept us going on an early long railway trip. Very thoughtful."}
{"text": "Nothing. Staff used to be a bit offhand but no longer all were really helpful. A good couple of night's stay."}
{"text": "Great location, property beautifully restored"}
{"text": "Rooms are small and service is extremely slow in the restaurant. My sorbet came to me in a slopping mess after having had to wait nearly half hour for it."}
{"text": "Great setting and heritage."}
{"text": "Our room had no view. So check before booking. The car service based in the hotel turned out to be by far the most expensive we used while in Sri Lanka."}
{"text": "We stayed at the GF on the first night of our trip to Sri Lanka and loved it so much that we decided to stay on our last night as well. Perfect welcome from staff, who were kind enough to upgrade us so that we could be closer to the pool, a cuddly toy for our new baby, beautiful room with Jacuzzi bath, delicious dinner and breakfast. Can't recommend highly enough."}
{"text": "I have never been so inspired by anywhere quite like the Galle Face Hotel.\rIt\u2019s rich in history, incredible art works, the hotel decor is so classic, yet warm and inviting. It uses a range of textures, fabrics, woods and colours. \rThe people who make the Galle Face so inviting with their warm smiles.\rThe day spa was exceptional.\rHighly recommend."}
{"text": "Old colonial building"}
{"text": "I was arriving early morning. To make sure that I do not encounter answer like: check in time is after 2 my room was paid from day before... well it was not ready! Of course I protested and made sure they read the reservation again. It took over an hour to clarify that. Honestly it should not happen. Then I was given far inferior room with dirty windows overlooking parking, for a short period. I moved to my room early afternoon. They should take off one night from my bill at least for that kind of service!!!! NO, they did not! So not such a great experience. \rI could stay in Shangrila just across where I have high status, I loved the look of the Galle Face..."}
{"text": "Bathroom is good, great water pressure. Great food and dining. Beds great. It\u2019s a lovely hotel."}
{"text": "We had to move a lot as we wanted and paid for 2 rooms which were not provided.. took a while to get the correct rooms."}
{"text": "We had a spacious comfortable room. The restaurant on the verandah serves varied buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner. At sunset, the flag is lowered by an official accompanied by a bagpipe player in kilt. Good salt-water pool."}
{"text": "We really loved our stay, in particular the decor and the ambience! Perfect location as well!! The breakfast was simply delicious! Very nice also the entrance and the first floor common areas!! Relaxing and fully of charme!"}
{"text": "The room was quite small, but this was part of the charme and we do not see it as a negative point! We would definitely come back!"}
{"text": "Large room and bathroom,very clean.No terras but the window can be opened. Staff very friendly. Beautiful spa, not cheap."}
{"text": "Swimming pool is with salt water."}
{"text": "I knew this was a hotel with a reputation but I genuinely didn't expect to be as blown away by it as I was. Gorgeous, grand place. We tried the seafood restaurant and it was lovely. A holy day so no alcohol design at the bar but still a glorious place. If you have the ability walk up and down the stairs rather than use the lifts. Even the atrium areas are amazing!"}
{"text": "Nothing!"}
{"text": "The communal rooms were great...fantastic old colonial feel. Our room had a great view."}
{"text": "The lighting was rather dim and the towels etc in the bathroom in short supply..."}
{"text": "Overrated.  A very old hotel that does a poor job with soundproofing. Woke up when someone above my room started his morning prayers with a loud speaker."}
{"text": "The room is very comfortable and the complementary mini bar facility we enjoyed. Breakfast had a vast spread of food and delicious. Hotel staff is friendly and supportive."}
{"text": "The pool has no shallow end so a person who can't swim better can't enjoy the salt water pool. No view from the room."}
{"text": "Great location and the service was friendly if slightly slow. My big comment was that we ate at 3 restaurants, the Verandah, the Sea Spray and 1864. The Verandah and Sea Spray were excellent, see below for the 1864."}
{"text": "1864 was poor actually. Service was fine although it took an age for the wine to arrive as they had to get it from Sea Spray, but the food was far too western in a country with so much wonderful food. It was also empty on a Saturday night probably because of that."}
{"text": "Lovely room (in spite of being street-side (still not too noisy). Excellent fish restaurant (Sea Spray) looking over Indian Ocean) British Raj-type architecture  in wonderful setting."}
{"text": "Staff (especially at buffet restaurant in evening) slow and lacked a welcoming smile (otherwise the key feature of Sri Lankan hospitality). Had problems and delays with correct billing for what we ate (nobody explained the computer was down!) ...not the best experience in our jetlagged state, so sadly we were left feeling the \"raj experience\" was a bit wanting."}
{"text": "The room (2044) was big and comfortable. It included breakfast and evening drinks + canap\u00e9s in the Long Room; very quiet with personal service. Food was excellent. The hotel itself is a classic example of British colonial architecture, a welcome change from the usual 5-star places."}
{"text": "Pool a bit small; limited space which could get crowded."}
{"text": "A lovely old colonial building, directly on the ocean.\rWe loved sitting in the garden, watching the sunset.\rFood was excellent and very tasty, the SPA area a bit too cold\rbut worth a visit. Go and see the little museum."}
{"text": "A horrible construction zone is spoiling the view. Investors are building an island  right infront of Galle Face, call it Harbour city, with skyscrapers, Dubai style for many people. It is very very sad and will destroy the charme of the whole area."}
{"text": "Really excellent service, fantastic breakfast!"}
{"text": "Not the hotel\u2019s fault...I feel sad  that there is a huge construction project underway, north of Galle Face Green. It doesn\u2019t spoil the sunset view and some people who love building things will be fascinated, but it is constrast with this lovely hotel!"}
{"text": "The hotel is very classic - colonial style but the rooms are well furnished and modern. We received a free upgrade to a suite, which was fantastic. The breakfast buffet has a nice spread of Western and local fare."}
{"text": "Milk Toffee on Arrival was a very nice touch.  The in house museum and library gave a great sense of history of the hotel along with the painting and photographs of the hotel in its past glory.  The Breakfast buffet was amazing.  The Lo'ocitane spa was fabulous!  In particular the  grounds facing west are a great spot for a drink whilst watching the sun go down."}
{"text": "On check in we were told our room would be affected by noise.  when we requested to be relocated they were quite reluctant to do so, but in the end accommodated our request.  A very minor blemish on what was a great stay."}
{"text": "Colonial style. Location - listening to the waves break enjoying a drink/dinner. Excellent level of service. Sea Spray restaurant - great venue and great food."}
{"text": "Hotel can feel a bit tired - but it is part of its colonial charm and heritage."}
{"text": "The room was perfect, with an amazing view to the sea and sunset, a very comfortable bed, and a lovely bathroom. The swimming pool is beautiful - cool salt water."}
{"text": "It was wonderful to live in a museum for 2 days. It looks amazing in the lobby, restaurants, library,  and the museum."}
{"text": "Unfortunately our room (4006) was a disappointment, the light was very unpleasant, the bathroom needs an urgent renovation (smells like mold), and the towels are grey instead of white."}
{"text": "It's not like a modern 5 star but it is well compensated by its caracter. Good breakfast but average coffe. High tea was excellent."}
{"text": "Not enough sun chairs at the pool. Only one hanger for bath towels is a bit annoying."}
{"text": "Fabulous and personalized attention. The hotel has a lovely view of the Indian Ocean with really nice sunsers. In the restaurant  they serve a buffet with different types of food every day. Always delicious."}
{"text": "I liked everything."}
{"text": "Great location with stunning views, and nice food. "}
{"text": "2 small things: Limited activities - which suited us, to be fair - and there were a lot of staff just sort of loitering around, which was mildly off-putting. \n"}
{"text": "Beautiful colonial building with wonderful sea views. Staff very friendly and the 1864 hotel restaurant was fantastic - best steak we've had in months."}
{"text": "The service could be very slow at times and the little touches you expect from a five star hotel were missing."}
{"text": "This is simply a great hotel. It is old - 1860s -  but beautifully renovated. It is right on the ocean front and a 15-20 walk to the Fort area of Colombo. The seafood restaurant is superb. Great service, large comfortable and clean rooms, excellent public area inside and outside. Why stay in other hotels that cost as much or more when you get such character at the Galle Face."}
{"text": "Nothing."}
{"text": "The atmosphere is lovely and it was a pleasure to stay in such a historic building."}
{"text": "I had a couple of water problems in my bathroom which were rectified; the front desk staff were a) slow checking me in b) weren't great at recommending how to get to places, so do your own research. c) I stayed in one of their basic rooms which was frankly average so upgrade yourself I'm sure there are nicer rooms"}
{"text": "Our bed was comfy and we had an excellent dinner in the Sea Spray restaurant."}
{"text": "It took over an hour for us to be checked in and there was no explanation from the staff about how to use the bedroom control centre. the WIFI was not very fast."}
{"text": "An excellent start to our holiday and a nice gentle introduction to Sri Lanka the staff were helpful and friendly."}
{"text": "A room with a view our room faced out onto the noisy street and road below."}
{"text": "Galle Face Hotel is an institution in Colombo, for its heritage, service and location. I remember in from when I first stayed there 40 years ago. It has now been restored and the history and service maintained. Highly recommended!"}
{"text": "You pay for the experience. The price is prohibitive for some."}
{"text": "I had read about the Galle Face Hotel in a fictional book about the 1920's and have wanted to go there for a while.  Entrance lobby very welcoming and grand.  The staff were both friendly and very efficient.  Still had that air of colonial grandness even though has recently been renovated."}
{"text": "It is a real shame that such a beautiful and iconic hotel is soon to be surrounded by ugly tower blocks being built and the view to the West of the hotel and swimming pool is right in the line of huge building works being carried out for the new port.  Very soon Colombo will look like all the other big skyscraper cities in the world losing the charm.  The only thing I think could have helped is double glazing on the windows as you can hear the traffic as still single glazed."}
{"text": "Location. Good value for money."}
{"text": "Hidden costs. \rFalse advertising from Booking.com\rHidden charges. VAT, Breakfasts, etc.\rInflexible in room requests. Guests had to share beds or have fold up beds.\rIn practical room check in & check out"}
{"text": "Phenomenal view, amazing breakfast buffet, multiple bars and restaurants to choose from and an amazing pool. The building is 150 years old and has a long history of visiting writers, poets, politicians and other figures. The evening I arrived the Prime Minister of Singapore was dining in the higher-end restaurant - quite impressive! The property, pool, view, staff - everything exceeded my expectations. I was travelling alone on a stop before heading south and found the property very welcoming for a single traveler. I stayed in the \"old wing\" with a view of the courtyard and ocean and have to say of the 65+ countries I have traveled to this property makes the top ten!"}
{"text": "The tub in the bathroom (in the old wing) wouldn't drain very well so there was standing water while showering. The room itself is old but that is part of its charm. Also, there is not much to do in Colombo but that is not the fault of the hotel."}
{"text": "Almond croissant excellent and very wide choice"}
{"text": "Very small  point but would be good to allow Tuk Tuk to drop guests at reception rather than outside on the roadside"}
{"text": "Good old colonial style. Lots of famous people stayed here in the past. You feel like in Ritz or Claridges, but in the middle of dirty Colombo.\rNice little beach, beautiful bars and restaurants.\rFood at dinner and breakfast was good. \rTaxi to airport 3100 rupee (45 min on the high way)\rWiFi is good( usually not in the other hotels)"}
{"text": "Check in and check out could be quicker."}
{"text": "Hotel helped us with a very early Check-In and Upgrade and in general staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was great - nothing missing and great view. We enjoyed the pool - wonderful view and good water. Beautiful setting, wonderful hotel and very good pricing."}
{"text": "Being right at the seaside is so beautiful. Breakfast is fantastic. Being in this hotel with its history is a great experience."}
{"text": "We had a room without a view (onto a adjacent building) which considering the price was a bit disappointing. Not very soundproof, probably given the age of the building. We could hear everything on the TV of the room next door and all conversations in the hallway."}
{"text": "Old Colonial style of the hotel. Well maintained generally however sometimes lacked attention to detail.\rGood location for sightseeing.\rStaff were very polite and helpful but sometimes service was slow."}
{"text": "location is excellent"}
{"text": "housekeeping was very disappointing for a hotel this pricey. rooms were often not cleaned well enough. property , especially rooms not well maintained and not upto modern standards of comfort and service. Swimming pool was a disappointments - the shallow end was 1.5 metres, which meant people who are not serious swimmers cannot get into the pool at all."}
{"text": "This is a beautiful old colonial style hotel with a lovely pool and restaurant."}
{"text": "We were given a different room to the one we booked which we agreed to as we were told it had a gorgeous view. The view was very mediocre and the room was tiny. It was obviously one half of a family room as there was a door connecting the room to another but there was a small table put in front of it. The poor guest in the adjacent room was violently ill all day, night and morning and we heard every bit of it. When we raised this at reception they just shrugged their shoulders....not good enough really for a hotel of this standard."}
{"text": "Still maintains colonial style.great seawater swimming pool with sea breeze to keep you comfortable in the heat. Reception staff really helpful"}
{"text": "Nothing not to like!"}
{"text": "Was really looking forward to staying here again - I had fond memories of my stay several years ago. However on checking in I was told that the room (with double bed) I had booked over a month ago was not available. I was offered an \"upgrade\" - from Superior Queen to.... Superior Queen. That's some upgrade.\rOnly after an argument with a second check-in member of staff was the mistake acknowledged, and I was offered a change of room for the following day.\rI feel I shouldn't have to argue with staff merely to have my original booking honoured. Very disappointing and a sour end to my holidays in Sri Lanka. I will not be using the Galle Face Hotel again."}
{"text": "We had another very enjoyable stay at the hotel.\rFirst class service with very friendly staff who make you very welcome.\rComfortable room ,good facilities and great location on sea front.\rHighly recommend."}
{"text": "Nothing"}
{"text": "This is the fourth time I've stayed at Galle Face Hotel and I love it every time - a central location for the city right on the ocean.  Beautiful pool and restaurant areas and the careful room renovations still keep the hotel as special and characterful as before."}
{"text": "Beautiful old building, felt like going back in time. Never did guided tour but would have been interested considering the people that had stayed here over the years. Raising and lowering of flag accompanied by bagpipes. Food good quality. "}
{"text": "Beautiful luxurious historic colonial hotel, the restaurant food and drinks are expensive but service and food were of high quality.  We really enjoyed our stay here and loved having drinks on the terrace to watch the sunset.  Swimming pool area was great to relax and just outside the hotel door is the hustle and bustle of Colombo, however  as soon as you step inside it is is an oasis of calm.  Coffee was the best we had in Sri Lanka. Check out the hotel museum near the library room and see the famous people that stayed including a well known Cuban revolutionary!"}
{"text": "Nothing."}
{"text": "Gorgeous heritage hotel in a grand colonial-style building. The verandah is an amazing spot to watch the sunset with a cocktail in hand. Rooms are spacious and the beds are very comfy, especially by Sri Lanka standards. Staff are lovely and friendly."}
{"text": "The bathroom in our room was a little tired looking, but otherwise clean."}
{"text": "This is the hotel to stay in when visiting Colombo. The staff were so helpful and lovely. The hotel is gorgeous and all the facilities are maintained to a very high standard. The pool and views are beautiful, food delicious and the hotel is very grand. A real luxury and brilliant first two nights in Sri Lanka. Definetly walk along Galle Face Green and head to the Ministry of Crab in a tuk tuk for dinner.... book first though."}
{"text": "Nothing"}
{"text": "Beautiful old hotel. Lovely outdoor gardens. Book a suite room for complimentary access to the Long Room (free breakfast buffet and evening drinks). Staff were lovely and attentive. "}
{"text": "Breakfast was good ,  Location on Galle face is excellent."}
{"text": "First room offered very noisy, second room was found to be infested by sugar ants. Management tried to resolve all issues but in a short 2 night stay it's hard to keep moving rooms. I compare this hotel to Mount Lavinia hotel , sorry Guys you come second"}
{"text": "Am a return guest so always good to go back and kindly upgraded my room, wouldn't stay anywhere else in Colombo . Excellent cocktails"}
{"text": "Buffet style supper not as good as last time, but alone it's easier than sitting in one of the restaurants by oneself ."}
{"text": "The hotel is in an excellent location next to the sea, with a pleasant outside bar area and pool, and very comfortable rooms. Staff were helpful."}
{"text": "The hotel was more expensive than we expected as we had not realised 30% tax was not included in the prices cited on the booking.com website."}
{"text": "The buffet breakfast was amazing and the views from the veranda just delightful for a great start to the day. The friendly staff and and beautiful building make this a place you should not miss staying in whilst in Sri Lanka."}
{"text": "Beautiful hotel"}
{"text": "Wild new years party that took over the hotel. They provided no advanced notice. Party was extremely loud and went past 6am in the morning. We were not advised of the party ahead of time. Party goers snuck on to our balcony in the middle of the night causing mayhem. The hotel staff were surly and not helpful."}
{"text": "We were in a relatively small room with 2 twin beds, but with a side view of the ocean, which we could still hear, and a very comfortable and cozy feeling overall.  Staff were very professional and accommodating; prices a little higher than other hotels we stayed at in Colombo, but not drastically so, and the beauty of the hotel overall easily made up for these small concerns.  Some of the other rooms we saw, going for a higher price, were spectacular, if you like a more colonial look.  Breakfast buffet was exceptionally good."}
{"text": "Our room was a little small and, although the mini bar was free (a nice touch), there was no beer or wine or even chocolate in it as we expected from other hotels."}
{"text": "We were welcomed and our bags taken care of, everyone spoke good english and it was the best customer service we had in all of Sri Lanka."}
{"text": "Pool bar staff could be a little quicker"}
{"text": "The place had character!\rOur room was very comfortable and so well appointed. All staff were very polite and helpful.\rBreakfast was plenteous and delicious.\rDinner at the sea food restaurant was extremely good and our waiter so helpful."}
{"text": "Very little!"}
{"text": "I did not like the checkin cuz we arrived from an overseas trip at 7am and they let us in the lobby for 5 hours and did not offer us breakfast . After charging me 800 USD and after the long wait they tell us one room is ready and the room was not what I reserved.. and The charged me more money on my card 325 USD with out my authorization from me and that was done when I was standing in front of them I was shocked that I got msg from my bank I told them why when the manger check with fin dep he said sorry this will be reimbursed to my card and they did the same day cuz I was there\rThe shocking thing after two days of checking out they changed me 708.14 USD and I called and they say it's holidays and they will back in my card I wish I was in Colombo so I can face them like the 325 dollars that they return right away\rPlz booking.com , note this and help me ..\rP.s.\rI wish that I payed cash at this Hotel"}
{"text": "Taking money with out my authorization, first time it happen to me in a 5 star hotel !!!!"}
{"text": "The Galle Face Hotel is a beautiful piece of history. Set right on the beach, it offers lovely sunset viewing from the terrace restaurant or bar. The decor is a nice mix of modern and old; and the rooms are well appointed with comfy beds & pillows. Get a good spot on the porch/terrace, a nice cocktail & watch the sun go down while the piper plays & the flag is lowered. Very special."}
{"text": "Nothing"}
{"text": "Liked the food and afternoon tea. And the historic touch. The pool is large."}
{"text": "Limited numbers of chairs by the pool. Surrounding area boring. No possibility to bath in the ocean depending on heavy Waves."}
{"text": "An incredible hotel. If you want one night of luxury during your trip to Sri Lanka, stay here. Service is impeccable and the view from the pool can be stared at all day."}
{"text": "Nothing."}
{"text": "Galle Face hotel is an awesome place to stay in Colombo. It\u2019s a beautiful hotel with an old colonial feel. The staff were lovely and the room was very comfortable."}
{"text": "Lovely food - breakfast was just fabulous as was the evening meal\rLovely pool area and wonderful history\rLovely old hotel with old world class"}
{"text": "Changing facilities near pool a bit basic"}
{"text": "Bit of a treat for us in a suite with balcony overlooking pool. We often stay in smaller places so when we do spend 5-10 times our usual nightly amount have certain hopes and expectations!!..... that the Galle Face achieved and exceeded! Great staff, excellent food,  beautiful old building, great location, nice little treats (like minibar goodies) , good pool, excellent room, complimentary fruit etc etc. My test is always ... .. would we spend this amount and stay again? 100% we would! Thanks!"}
{"text": "The hotel itself was very nice. Great accommodations, amazing pool, great restaurants (more than 1 option which is great!)."}
{"text": "Our room was not great. For what we paid, we got a room not overlooking anything that was much smaller than the images I saw when booking..."}
{"text": "Lovely old hotel, great swimming pool and loved the sound of the waves crashing at night. Decent buffet breakfast and very good location to walk to other restaurants in the evening. Liked the pool bar especially at sunset"}
{"text": "The service could have been a bit better. Reception staff were good but the staff at breakfast were very slow!"}
{"text": "We had a triple room for me and 2 teenagers. It was perfect with a seperate room with sofa bed and another TV and wel stocked barcfu of treats. The complimentary Long bar on the second floor for breakfast and happy hour was stunning.  The pool is nicely positioned looking over the each."}
{"text": "Not enough sun beds by the pool. Very noisy late at night with party music from downstairs."}
{"text": "The fantastic heritage building\rSea view and nice bar, breakfast in the coursives\rLocation"}
{"text": "Old and slow elevators\rQuietness of rooms is poor: hearing strong waves and train being in the aisle facing the railway\rSpa was under renovation but once finished it will be great"}
{"text": "Very colonial in both architecture, aesthetics and feel. Good beachfront location, with friendly & helpful staff. Great food and sea views from the various seating areas."}
{"text": "The hotel itself is stunning and watching the sunset by the pool is quite remarkable however it is spoiled by hostile staff."}
{"text": "Although the hotel itself is beautiful the staff are shamefully unprofessional and unpleasant to deal with. Staff in the Verandah restaurant  are especially hostile which makes for a terrible start to the day. I didn\u2019t appreciate the constant staring by male staff as I spent time by the pool.  Email and social media communication is appalling. You are not made to feel welcome at the this hotel. It is truly disappointing as the building itself is really breath taking."}
{"text": "The buffet breakfast was comprehensive and tasty. The staff were very friendly and professional. Beautiful communal areas, this is a grand lady of a hotel."}
{"text": "The gym was closed during my admittedly brief stay, and with the huge selection available at breakfast and the one evening meal I attended, I could have done with working out."}
{"text": "Good breakfast. Great pool. Lovely Colonial charm to this hotel."}
{"text": "Check in very lengthy process. We asked for connecting rooms and they couldn't accommodate us even though we were all one family so ended up on different floors. One room was much better than the other (view of the sea as opposed to the view of a brick wall) even though the prices were exactly the same. The breakfast is very nice. Good pool right on the beach. The staff were friendly."}
{"text": "The location of the hotel being right at the waters edge was\ramazing. Our room was sea facing and the sound of the waves\rwas therapy for a restful nights sleep."}
{"text": "When we reached the hotel after a long drive from\rNuwara Eliya , the welcome and check in was disappointing.\rDefinitely not in keeping with the other 5 star hotels we use.\rThe staff especially at the front desk were very impersonal.\rUnlike other 5 star hotels they were not very familiar with their\rguests."}
{"text": "The Hotel is a superb example of colonial charm and decadence and is run with military precision. It is located in a prime part of Colombo and is located a short tuk tuk ride to places of interest. It was a treat to stay there and an experience we hope very much to repeat."}
{"text": "Nothing that could be improved upon by the hotel."}
{"text": "Location and outside look of hotel"}
{"text": "Very basic and old rooms.\rPrice of booking was not respected. I was charged 40 USD on top of price of reservation without explanation, unacceptable!"}
{"text": "Buffet was excellent, great choice and variety. Staff were very good, attentive and friendly."}
{"text": "The pool was quite deep, even the shallow end which was very small, not good for a non swimmer. The room was a little smaller than I expected but quite comfortable. Also the spa and gym were out of service due to renovations. I was a little disappointed as I had intended to use the spa and using out off site is not the same experience."}
{"text": "Nice view of sea"}
{"text": "Room was pokey with lots of glitches. The temperature of the shower couldn\u2019t be controlled so far too hot \u2014 and, despite having asked for it to be repaired, nothing was done even by the second day."}
{"text": "Got a free upgrade to a junior suite as we were early & our original room was not yet made. Beds super comfy!"}
{"text": "The location of the room was right above the hall which played extremely loud music till 1130 the 2 nights we were there. It is impossible to sleep in that room."}
{"text": "clean good location and choice of breakfast was very good"}
{"text": "took longer to check in and did not offer any drinks while we were waiting for the check in process"}
{"text": "I thought the staff and the actual accommodation was the best part of our stay.  We ate in the seafood restaurant which was lovely.  Also the hotel had a lovely fragrant smell and is situated on the ocean.  We would look out of our hotel room and take in the scenery."}
{"text": "The coffee wasn't the best but that's just my personal opinion, my husband enjoyed his coffee!"}
{"text": "The colonial feel"}
{"text": "There was a loud band on the first night on the floor below : loud enough to feel the music thru the floorboards\rBut they finished up before midnight so all was OK"}
{"text": "Sumptous breakfast, fantastic restaurant Seaspray 10 m from the ocean with waves crushing in and good seafood\ud83d\ude0a"}
{"text": "Difficult to communicate with them via email \ud83d\ude14 No answer!"}
{"text": "- Very attentive staff\n- There is a lovely seafood restaurant downstairs\n- Great selection for breakfast\n"}
{"text": "- Room felt a bit outdated, although I think that\u2019s the look they are going for\n- We got a tour from one of the hotel staff and it ended in the jewellery shop where we felt pressure to buy something. \n"}
{"text": "The room was outstanding as we got a free upgrade. Couldn't have asked for much more."}
{"text": "The adjoining room as we had noisy neighbours. We called the reception but it persisted until we had to get up for our flight at 5am."}
{"text": "Spacious bed room facing Galle Green. Breakfast is very well laid and carries variety of items - to meet the local and foreign pallet."}
{"text": "The layout of room could be ergonomically worked upon. Ironing board could be placed in room and lighting system needs improvement."}
{"text": "The pool was the best thing about the hotel."}
{"text": "The Spa was being renovated - didn't know this in advance.\rThe staff were not as accommodating and helpful as you would expect at a hotel of this level.  The restaurant could do with some sort of air conditioning - pretty uncomfortable in the heat."}
{"text": "Lovely history and ambiance and location, and very good staff (as we encountered all over Sri Lanka).  On my request, the hotel laid on some flowers and a cake for my wife's birthday which was well appreciated"}
{"text": "Thought the room was a little small but then everywhere else on our travels we had extremely large rooms, so maybe we were spoilt a little.  I also thought that what we paid for our kind of balcony room was well over the top"}
{"text": "Breakfast was good with a wide variety.staff where very nice and helpful"}
{"text": "Room felt standard whilst you where paying for luxury. Bar was expensive and didn\u2019t seem alot to do around the property, also there was a small beach but swimming was prohibited"}
{"text": "Still charming despite the recent renovations. Especially liked the Veranda Bar & Sea Spray restaurant with its excellent sea food."}
{"text": "Having arrived from Delhi on a morning flight, I reached the Galle Face at about 11am & had to wait two hours before a room was available -- and I was extremely tired!"}
{"text": "A seemless blend of old and new with all the charm and convenience that you would expect.\rGin and tonic sundowners - excellent."}
{"text": "Beware the pork sausages at breakfast."}
{"text": "Lovely old hotel with original features. Spacious room with sea views."}
{"text": "The staff seemed largely indifferent (unlike other places in Sri Lanka). Room was spacious but bathroom in need of refurbishment (bath sealant was black and toilet flush problematic). Had agreed check out at 1pm but at 12.45 received call asking why we hadn't checked out. Wifi access ceased immediately on checkout so had to ask for extension whilst we waited for our driver (10 minutes extra was provided). Buffet meals were OK but expensive whilst fish restaurant prices based on price per 100g so no indication of final cost."}
{"text": "Very friendly and  courteous staff. Room was fantastic, Beautiful and clean. The view from the room was breathtaking. Food was marvellous. Enjoyed the fruit basket. Wish I had more days booked."}
{"text": "Colonial charm, excellent food, very helpful staff. The breakfast buffet was wonderful with extensive local and western options. We had a huge room with a few of the stormy ocean. Excellent value compared to other places we stayed. "}
{"text": "Looking a bit run down, patchy paint, broken gutters"}
{"text": "It is a beautiful hotel to stay in. It was a treat to ourselves at the end of our holiday after staying in guest houses for the rest of the holiday. It has a bit more character than most posh hotels. We loved it. The food was excellent too."}
{"text": "There's really nothing not to like."}
{"text": "The bed was very comfortable and we were in a good position near the pool and spa. The staff are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text": "The spa was closed and we were not informed. The checkerboard terrace was not available because of weddings. The bridal preparation room was directly opposite ours so there was a lot of disturbacnce, especially at night after 11:00pm from the wedding party."}
{"text": "Grand hotel with a rich history. Lovely sea views. Excellent breakfast at The Verandah. Sea water swimming pool is quite unique. "}
{"text": "Staff, though friendly and well mannered, were often slow to respond to basic requests. Gym and Spa were closed for renovation during our stay. "}
{"text": "This hotel has a very special and unique ambience---I would rate it amongst the top three hotels I have stayed at the past 10 years (and I have stayed at more than a 100) The old-world feel combined with the beauty of the surroundings make for a super vacation. The staff (all the staff) went out of their way to be friendly and helpful; day and night. The different restaurants offered a splendid variation of dining options at reasonable prices"}
{"text": "I liked everything"}
{"text": "Great historic hotel. Room was large with a large modern bathroom.\rPool area has great views right on the beach front. Breakfast restaurant had a good variety of quality food in a nice location.\rHotel is walking distance to the Old Dutch Hospital so good for tourists"}
{"text": "The location was beautiful. The hotel itself is beautiful and the full of history. The room was larger and clean and comfortable. The restaurant is very good."}
{"text": "Nothing really. You can't swim at their beach because of safety considerations, but that's not a big deal."}
{"text": "Beeing just direkt by the sea!"}
{"text": "The Hotel inside should have more colours! The corridors are too dark and smell  as they were built 3000 years ago.... Also the poolside and surrounding looks poor and not fresh. You have not even enough sombrellos for every guest.... needs definitely renovation work. And the small sunshelter above the windows shiuld be painted yellow!! The hotel would then look fresher and more interesting!!also needs definitely more trees outside!"}
{"text": "The hotel is a grand old colonial building with great staff and a lovely terraces. The seafood restaurant was excellent and good value for money."}
{"text": "Parts of the hotel looked a little tired and our room was small and dark."}
{"text": "The breakfast buffet was fabulous with a range of Sri Lankan curries, hoppers, and western options like croissants and eggs."}
{"text": "No hooks in the bathroom for hanging clothes."}
{"text": "It is an awful destination. The price of this hotel is never $195."}
{"text": "Exuberant price, low quality, and untrustworthy booking.com website. Galle face hotel is an awful very expensive hotel."}
{"text": "The location is great, right next to galle face green and it is on the beach. Although you can not swim at the beach, it was perfect for viewing sunsets."}
{"text": "The service by staff could be hit and miss. For the most part the service was great."}
{"text": "We were made to feel welcome and comfortable throughout the entire day and night until our midnight flight, even though we had checked out in the morning. Also gave us a later checkout and assisted us with our phone issues."}

{"text": "Front desk/concierge could have been more helpful with questions we had."}
{"text": "The breakfast was wonderful. For us it was the welcome to lovely Sri Lanka , and the bed made us rest to recover from our trip ...really comfortable  "}
{"text": "Nothing "}
{"text": "I loved that the building was this an old colonial building, with so much history. I especially loved that the pool was a sea water pool."}
{"text": "I dealt with a young recruit for check-in &check out. And while he had the best intentions, he was quite inexperienced and it became an unduly delayed check out.\rAlso, one of our rooms smelt fowl (some problem with the toilet). They were kind enough to change the room.\rThe superior rooms were very small & tight to negotiate."}
{"text": "Staff services excellent. I got  a room with sea view+harbour. Room service food very good. enjoyed the stay. will come again to stay\rBeds very good. laundry services excellent Bathroom was at a good standing  complementary bar fridge free of charge."}
{"text": "the room bar fridge leeching and the room phone not working. Staff helped to repair same."}
{"text": "Loved the location . Very close to Galle Face Walk and Colombo."}
{"text": "Our room was comfortable but old. We invited family for dinner and we were very disappointed with the buffet. The people in charge at the restaurant were not very friendly. It was clearly just a job to them . Disappointing"}
{"text": "This is a hotel that is a good 150 years old. It is right at the heart of Colombo.\rWe loved the food and ambience of the restaurants, the only salt water pool by the sea and the fact that it was so connected. The Main Street and the Dutch hospital are nearby where we wanted to visit."}
{"text": "There was a wedding at the lower level which created some noise for a bit literally thumping on our floor."}
{"text": "Breakfast was incredible!! One of the best we've had in Sri Lanka .. Sri Lankan curry was spot on. And for those not eating Sri Lankan food such a good spread of continental breakfast. Great quality and taste. \rThe restaurants and bar are right by the sea .. incredible views. \rAbsolutely beautiful property"}
{"text": "We got our rooms 2 hours after check in time"}
{"text": "I have been staying at the galle face for over three decades. I love the atmosphere and for me it's always like home"}
{"text": "While I understand that the hotel needed refurbishment it has lost a lot of its character. Sofas in the galle instead of Sri Lankan rathan chairs and chaise lounges and no information of the historical role of the hotel and the people who stayed there"}
{"text": "I loved the location and the room. The staff were polite but totally inefficient- had to ask them for service several times before they even responded and repeat the request several times after which they got it wrong.\rThe High Tea was awful. There was too much bread in the finger sandwiches and not enough fillings. Too few savouries. Poor quality cakes. The service was appalling. I had to ask for tea for one of my guests several times - I had to repeat myself to 3 different waiters who all got it wrong though I speak fluent English and Sinhalese and repeated my very simple request many times in both languages. In Colombo there are many hotels including  4 and 5 star hotels and restaurants that do high tea and this was the worst high tea I have ever had in Sri Lanka. Tourists probably think this is the high tea in Sri  Lanka and they would be wrong!\rThe hotel advertises airport transfers which should be free but they tried to charge me an exorbitant fee. I called a local taxi ( Kangaroo cabs 0112 285 285) and got  an air conditioned saloon car with a polite and efficient driver for Rs 2850/- for my flight at 3 am we left at 12:45 am and was at the airport by 1:15 and my driver got me a trolley and loaded my bags onto it too \r. Don't waste you money and take a hotel taxi which costs about $80 (Rs 12,345) Breakfast was bad too. A tip stay there for the ambience if you like but walk across ( a short distance) to Cinnamon Grand have their high tea and breakfasts and food."}
{"text": "Service and food both appalling"}
{"text": "the junior suite was spacious with many complimentary services."}
{"text": "The bottom sheet on the bed wasn't made properly and kept coming untucked ... this is the only thing I can find wrong!!"}
{"text": "I\u2019ve booked the hotel for 5 nights, when I booked it showed that it had a gym and spa, but when I got there the gym and the spa was closed for renovations, I told the hotel that I want to cancel my stay in the hotel, and the staff was so helpful and booking.com customer support helped me too, the hotel offered me an upgrade to suit, but i said no and they only charged me the night I stayed and refunded rest of the money, \rThe hotel is beautiful, nice sea view, and stuff was so helpful."}
{"text": "They gym and spa was under renovation"}
{"text": "Good breakfast buffet - worth the extra charge"}
{"text": "Relatively pricy hotel for Sri Lankan standards and doesn't really live up to its 5 star promise: Neither the rooms not the service is as good as it should be."}
{"text": "Food was good, staff by pool and in the restaurants were nice."}
{"text": "Reception staff left our luggage sitting out in a corner of reception where anyone could have taken them. They didn't ask for our tag when we took our luggage from there. When I complained reception staff laughed in my face and were very rude."}
{"text": "Great atmosphere. Delicious food at the fish restaurant (quite pricey though). Pleasant service. Spacious and comfortable room."}
{"text": "The Spa has been under renovation for a long time now so there is no spa or gym available. This does not appear to be considered in the room rates."}
{"text": "B'fast"}
{"text": "Porters Service on Checkout. None one took any initiative to load our luggage into our car. We were getting late for our flight. Finally our nephew had to take the car keys from the doorman and he him selves went to the car park drove the car to the front entrance and started loading our luggage.\rPorters were standing and watched us. The Manager on duty came and told them to Hurry  up and load our luggage . Then two porters started moving. \rHotel has a strong mold smell. Over spray of air freshers in the lobby and in corridors. We were upgraded to a junior suite. I would not call that a junior suite. It is large double room for us."}
{"text": "Public areas and restaurants here were wonderful- historic, stylish and full of character. \rStaff could not do enough to make us comfortable. \rBreakfast was superlative, and all meals were excellent and reasonably priced for a hotel of this type. \rWe stayed here twice. On our first visit our room was very disappointing- poorly maintained, and overlooking a noisy building site. When we checked out, I spoke to the manager and expressed my concern that upon our return in two weeks, we would not have a similar room. He was most responsive, and when we returned, we had a hugely upgraded room, enormous,  with sweeping views."}
{"text": "Some rooms are very ordinary- old and badly maintained. If you are given one of these, ask for a room change."}
{"text": "I liked very little about this hotel. Rooms are large, airy and quite comfortable."}
{"text": "Ambiance nice and it's all spruced up and restored, however, management and staff attitudes leave much to be desired. Staff seem to be more interested in talking to each other or on their mobile phones than paying attention to guests and their needs. I stood for five minutes at the restaurant overlooking the sea in front of two staff members who continued to talk with each other rather than attend do me and show me to a table till I interrupted them. In the bar, there were staff members everywhere, however, the service was awful! I think they all need re-training. Doormen on the main entrance had the strange habit of holding the door open with a foot so guests could enter or exit while they talked on the phone. On my last night, there was a huge row in the room above me with things seemingly being thrown around and occupants shouting at each other. It woke me at 0400 and continued till 0600 when it suddenly stopped. Hotel management did not seem to be able to stop it."}
{"text": "Location is great and the restaurants serve excellent buffet lunch and dinner."}
{"text": "The old wing was a bit dated (especially the toilet) despite the renovation. The second night we stayed at the new wing, which has better decoration (new room) but we were bombarded with loud music from the ballroom nearby. Loud music didn't stop until 10:45pm and we had an early flight. Very frustrating."}
{"text": "Staff absolutely lovely. Breakfast was delicious...so many things to choose from. Didn't need to eat again until late evening! Lovely to see this colonial building maintain its traditional look and feel. Amazing views."}
{"text": "This is odd but the overpowering smell in the lobby made me dizzy! It's like lillys mixed with some exotic airfreshner and I couldn't stay in there too long, it gave me a headache! The walls are pretty thin unfortunately so I was disturbed in my sleep a couple of times. "}
{"text": "We were five people, who requested 2 rooms next to each other. But that wasn't given. Then when we all spent some time together in one room, the manager remarked that they don't allow so many people in one room, which was odd. We had rude people staying next door, and the manager almost justified their behavior."}
{"text": "Lovely old colonial hotel, great bar and restaurant overlooking the sea and nice pool. Very comfortable room and great bathroom. A good place to stay."}
{"text": "Lovely period property, complete with museum about the hotel's fascinating history. Right on the beach and facing the Galle Face green, where kids fly kites and families walk along the sea. The newly renovated wing is definitely better as the older wing smells a little damp."}
{"text": "I'd have liked more la carte options (and local food over international), as there seems to be a love of buffet dining."}
{"text": "A grand old hotel which has retained it's old time feel. The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable. a great hotel breakfast on the terrace and swim in the generous pool overlooking the ocean, made it even better."}
{"text": "Room had no view"}
{"text": "Everything in this hotel was according to what we expected. History reflected everywhere and the verandas were beautiful. The breakfast location was amazing whereas the hotel was very centrally located. The room facilities were very good and I will gladly stay here again."}
{"text": "Loved the history of the bus.ding and the renovation of it was beautiful. Pool was lovely and the food and service amazing."}
{"text": "Our room didn't have a great view but we weren't there all that long. Probably a bit overpriced."}
{"text": "The whole place is steeped in history and has a luxurious colonial feel. Its a nice experience to sit and enjoy a location where so many famous characters have visited and although it is expensive for Sri Lanka it is good value compared to similar hotels in England, even if only for a night. We enjoyed the buffet and cocktails and felt it was a lovely closing evening to our holiday in Sri Lanka."}
{"text": "This hotel is fabulous from its setting to its history it has everything to make your stay a sweet memory. Staff are superb and the food excellent. Several restaurants within hotel to suit all budgets. Rooms great and spacious. Can't praise this hotel enough."}
{"text": "Great property with a lot of history attached to it. The staff was extremely polite and helpful. Central location being itself a tourist attraction. Even the sunset high teas were memorable "}
{"text": "Everything. From the view to architecture, the hotel is awesome. Only problem was, we got old wing and not the renovated one even though, we paid similar price. But barring that, everything else was just perfect. "}
{"text": "Rooms in the old wing and not the renovated one. "}
{"text": "Colonial hotel in prime condition. Nice fish resteraunt."}
{"text": "Offered an an inferor room to that booked. Had to view 5 rooms to get an apropriate one. Needed to be persistent. It's expensive paid \u00a3675 for 2 nights with dinner."}
{"text": "Was not worth at all for the paid amount, nothing was good to tell about the property. There was no proper n immediate response from staffs at reception."}
{"text": "Nothing i liked there to share, there was no door for bathing place..... wooden flooring in room was uncomfortable..... not sufficient light   "}
{"text": "Excellent  spread of  food. Great view of  sunset in the evening. Staff who understand  what personalized service is all about."}

{"text": "surly service at the main patio dining room. unhelpful and infriendly manager"}
{"text": "Lovely beds, lovely staff. Really beautiful and historical hotel. Loved the food that was served around the pool."}
{"text": "Couldn't fault anything except for the small lift!"}
{"text": "Great staff that knows the true value of customer service special mention for reception and the restaurant first class service.  if you are going to Colombo, this is the best hotel to stay in. \rit just shows part of Colombo history."}
{"text": "The old British style building is amazing. The service is extraordinary and the location couldn't be better. If you book a Suite, you have access to the executive lounge, where you can enjoy delicious snacks and an fantastic view."}
{"text": "Design of the furniture, flooring, bathroom was nice, prestige factor"}
{"text": "Windows were very dirty, the hotel staff expects the guests to tip generously all the time, slippery floorboards in the main restaurant (i fell down), there were total of 3 guests, they did not bring extra bath towels, bath robes and extra cups, loud maintenance work was being done next door, our room had a view to the sea but also the garbage area"}
{"text": "Truly historic hotel, beautiful colonial building and fabulous sunset views from the bar. Breakfast the best we had in Sri Lanka and lovely salt water pool, even in the rain!"}
{"text": "The rooms we were given were small and with the wooden floors soundproofing was an issue. I appreciate it is a very old building but I think you pay for the name when you come here. Time again I'd probably go for a sunset drink but not stay."}
{"text": "I was charged double as they had my credit card in their system. And the staff refused to rwsolve the issue with booking.com. and  no reply from customer services of booking. Com"}
{"text": "Roons stink"}
{"text": "Deluxe hotel, great location right on the waterfront and the Galle Face Green. Excellent buffet dinner."}
{"text": "Strong smell of sewage from somewhere nearby made evening poolside drinks unpleasant one night."}
{"text": "Absolutely everything ....it was a real treat to come back to The Galle Face. I recommended it to friends and the 4 of us spent 3 night there. BUT..........."}
{"text": "As 4 \"seniors\", we were grateful and delighted with the upgrade given to us when we arrived.  I was unable to book this hotel in 1985 and it was a dream to finally stay there after all these years.\nAll was superb. BUT.... On our last night, we went to bed at 9pm  as my partner was suffering from food poisoning.  But it was impossible to rest or sleep due to unbearable loud music which actually made the whole room and bed vibrate, it was so loud. The noise apparently was coming from a large function directly below our room. By around 10.45pm, I had had enough and went down to the reception in my dressing gown. The night manager came up and politely agreed the noise was unexceptionable. He said I was not the only room which had complained. He offered the choice of another room (what? change rooms with a sick man in tow?), move to the room's slightly quieter lounge area which has a sofa couch (Still not acceptable with the price we were paying), and a pot of green tea. The latter was accepted along with the promise that the music would stop at 11.30. Well, the noise certainly was reduced but absolutely not eliminated. So, around midnight, my partner, who had had no sleep to assist with his sickness, asked me to call reception and we complained yet again. By this time, we were so upset and angry...sleep was simply not possible for some hours.\nWhat I want to ask is...\n1. Why are you...a 5 star hotel, subjecting your guests to this unacceptable disturbance, when you must know that the noise which affects this and other rooms is unacceptable....under any circumstances.\n2. Isn't your guests experience at your hotel of paramount importance?\n3. Why do you not block these rooms from sale when you must know you will get dissatisfied guests and risk complaints.\n On checkout....Nothing was offered to me in compensation and I had to re-iterate the story plus exhibit  strong dissatisfaction before the duty front office manager eventually reduced our bill."}
{"text": "Staff were very friendly and helpful, they could not do enough for you. Although service in the travellers bar was rather slow. Breakfast was very good with uninterrupted views of the sea. Our room was very comfortable although slightly on the small side for the price. The free mini bar was a good plus too"}
{"text": "The spa and gym facilities were closed."}
{"text": "Comfortable beds, good shower. Complimentary minibar with soft drinks and snacks. Staff were helpful. A lovely hotel but some disappointing aspects marred the overall experience."}
{"text": "Gym and sauna were closed. The view from our room wasn't great. 'Superior room' isn't superior by any standards."}
{"text": "This is a beautifully restored colonial building that oozes history. The level of luxury for the price is above and beyond what I had expected. My room was also HUGE! The location is about as good as you can get; though the area is quite pricey."}
{"text": "Absolutely stunning, a real treat of a hotel to spend the last night of our Sri Lanka holiday. Definitely worth checking in and spending most of the time there! Just had a superior room and it was gorgeous, lovely furnishings, FREE minibar, view of the pool/sea, welcome lemonade and fudge, the most elegant and courteous staff. The hotel has so much to offer you barely need to leave."}
{"text": "Outside of windows was a bit foggy so was not really a clear view, but that didn't matter much - we were not there to spend the day in our room!"}
{"text": "We tried to change our booking to a tariff (booking.com) to include breakfast but it seemed all too hard. The hotel never responded to our request and on arrival they told us we should have contacted Booking.com but that is never easy either."}
{"text": "From floorboard to furniture in the lobbies, the whole atmosphere breathes Campherwood, Teak and Ebony. One expects to find Agatha Christie or Lord Mountbatten sipping tea under the Verandah. Class and charm."}
{"text": "backpackers and batik pants just don't fit there but money has no smell it seems."}
{"text": "The hotel was beautiful old world charm.  The flag lowering in the evening was beautiful with the playing of the bagpipes."}
{"text": "We would have liked a larger room, quite expensive for the size"}
{"text": "Great breakfast buffet, excellent cocktails, good room."}
{"text": "Staff couldn't find my reservation, which was kind of annoying. Strange inconsistencies. I stayed here twice on the same trip, First time, no welcome drink, but bottled water and fruit provided poolside. Second stay, there was a welcome drink, but no water or fruit poolside. For this price, it should be consistent. Food at the dinner buffet not as good as breakfast, and should be avoided."}
{"text": "The historical charm, the seawater swimming pool and unique surroundings."}
{"text": "Nothing, aside few behaviours amongst occupants forgetting manners (noise and outfit)."}
{"text": "This was the second time we stayed at this hotel. After a first experience rather poor, now we had a much better room in the renovated wing with a great sea view."}
{"text": "Magnificent view of the ocean.  Bar staff seemed the happiest."}
{"text": "Service at the breakfast restaurant was below standard.  Every staff seem harried.  The floors were grimy and looks like the balustrades and blinds have not been cleaned for ages.  Worse, a party was going on all night on Saturday and they stuck us in the wing that had the music the loudest.  Thank goodness we stayed only for one night for a connecting flight."}
{"text": "Excellent location with a nice variety of eating venues. Easy access to the Green and not far by transport to major sites of interest."}
{"text": "Poor signs, easy to get lost and to find venues. Needs a better informed tourist desk and disappointed they charged us over double the taxi fare back to the airport."}
{"text": "The wow factor as you walk in the hotel.  The hotel has plenty of history and the facilities are excellent.  The staff are polite but a little care free for my liking.  Good value considering it one of Sri Lankas best hotels."}
{"text": "Lack of beach in front of the hotel. Staff could do note to provide premium service.  The swimming pool could be bigger considering the size of the hotel.  Lack of warm greeting and lack of warm send off."}
{"text": "A beautifully restored colonial hotel in a great location.  The grounds, swimming pool, bars and restaurants are lovely with gorgeous views out to sea. A delicious buffet breakfast too."}
{"text": "Large, clean bathroom, the pool and restaurants are very nice. We had one of the best meals of our time in Sri Lanka in the seafood restaurant. The hotel has a strange, antique quality to it which isn't exactly luxurious but has an old-world charm that's quite unique, especially in an area of Colombo that's changing so dramatically."}
{"text": "We were initially \"upgraded\" to a suite which was dark and oddly laid out with chipped paint all over the balcony as it was next to the renovations. To be fair we were quickly moved to a smaller but far nicer room. The rooms are a little dated for a five star rating but it's still good value. Gym and spa currently closed for renovations."}
{"text": "I have stayed in many nice hotels around the world but I have to say I believe this is the best I've ever stayed. Location is excellent on the coast. The quality of finish and decor of the hotel public areas, rooms and bathrooms is superb. Some of the art work, particularly the terracotta wall in reception made me very envious. However the biggest accolade must go to the staff. Every single staff member we met was polite, attentive, helpful and cheerful. I must congratulate everyone at the hotel and cannot recommend it highly enough"}
{"text": "Expeccially the food was outstanding. After 3 Weeks travelling in Sri Lanka, the food was here for us 8 people the best. The mixture of all the ingredients was astonishing and inspiring. Our room - first floor was rather little but nice."}
{"text": "All of us did not really appreciate that waiters took our plates and glasses when we were eating. They seemed too quick in this. Transportation to the airport with the hotel van is very expensive!"}
{"text": "The hotel has a real sense of history and is very elegant and stylish.  The staff were all very helpful and attentive.  The breakfast buffet was magnificent, and the choice of food at the restaurants in house also excellent.  The saltwater pool is lovely and big. The history tour, museum and library also all very interesting.  Great location and view out to the ocean.  Perfect place to return to and relax after venturing out in to the hustle, bustle and heat of Colombo, particularly if you have just arrived in SL and need to acclimatise.  We were also interested to witness the wedding that took place during our stay and the daily traditional lowering of the flag at sunset heralded by a bagpiper in full regalia!"}
{"text": "The spa and gym were closed for renovations.  We were however given the option to use a gym in a nearby hotel.  Beds not that comfortable."}
{"text": "The staff were very friendly, we were greeted a refreshing lime juice after a very long journey from the UK. The location is near to Colombo Fort train station."}
{"text": "Nothing"}
{"text": "Old school charming hotel, polite and good staff. Very good salt water pool."}
{"text": "One room (#2021) was problematic due to extreme humidity accumulating, but we had it changed and did not pay for that night."}
{"text": "Hotel has a \"traditional feel\" of luxury all through. WE only stayed for one night on the way through Colombo but I had to drag the wife and kids (all over 18) away as they were enjoying the rooms / feel / views so much. \rWould thoroughly recommend"}
{"text": "hit check in at a busy period but they handled it well"}
{"text": "The service at Galle Face was exceptional and it is the most wonderful hotel to stay at. Gorgeous views from our room and the entire hotel. The pool and restaurant by the beach were divine. An absolute must to stay and very good value for money."}
{"text": "Nil"}
{"text": "Lovely hotel at a very convenient location. The pool and views are breathtaking and perfect for a relaxing drink or two! The hotel amenities and service was excellent."}
{"text": "The hidden 30% taxes that are applied on top of the room rate on booking.com. This was not the case at any of our other stays in Sri Lanka \rA triple room consisted of 2 beds where neither was able to fit 2 adults comfortably. Perhaps a queen and a single is more suitable for rooms expecting 3 guests. \rA concierge service for train tickets, short distance transport etc would have been helpful for a hotel of this class."}
{"text": "A beautiful must in Colombo! It was a perfect way to start our holiday in Sri Lanka - we got to taste a little of the colonial history from the beginning and was ready to experience the amazing Sri Lankan culture further. \rJust a unique historic experience - and at the same time great luxury. Funny to see all the pictures in the bar of the famous people who have stayed at the hotel during its long life. \rThe morning buffet was spetacular - and the passion daiquiry too :-)\rIn the evening we walked a long the shore from the hotel to the old Dutch hospital where we had a great Sri Lankan meal (20 mins walk)"}
{"text": "There was a historic tour around the hotel in the afternoon, which we missed since we saw the information about it too late. They should have informed about this when we arrived. We would have loved to experience this too. \rThe pool area is not safe for small kids - as there is no fence or border from the sun-beds to the very dangerous rocks and high waves just underneath. Keep the kids close :-) \rThe somewhat nasty and cheeky crows (that rules the Colombo area) are pretty annoying in the pool area - they will steal your food if you look away for just 20 seconds."}
{"text": "We had a great experience at this hotel.  I cannot fault it in any way.  Very comfortable, great setting.  I would stay here again."}
{"text": "Their communication could be improved."}
{"text": "Luxurious hotel in a great location. The whole hotel smells amazing and it's very high quality. Seaspray restaurant was brilliant."}
{"text": "The gym was closed for refurbishment and though there was another in walking distance down the road this was inconvenient. The restaurants are not great value for money considering the general price to eat out in Sri Lanka. Also a large group of teenagers - some sort of sports tour - we're a bit rowdy and swearing around the pool during our stay."}
{"text": "Good location, staff couldn't be nicer or more helpful. We left a kindle & they sent it by courier to our next hotel (150km away) at no extra cost. Now THAT Is good service!!"}
{"text": "Not much, it was very good!"}
{"text": "The staff were very friendly & helpful"}
{"text": "Original room was in the old fashioned end of the hotel & it was in need of some renovation but they upgraded us to a junior suite (for an extra \u00a330/ night) which was an amazing room with beautiful sea views"}
{"text": "The perfect place to start your Sri Lankan adventure. The hotel was so old world and you could imagine the British royals staying there in the Past. Breakfast overlooking he ocean was lovely, staff were super helpful and the door man in his regal 50 years of service uniform was special. We felt so comfortable, safe and walked everywhere because it was smack bang in the Centre. Highly recommend, beautiful service. "}
{"text": "What an amazing hotel!  We arrived late afternoon, and checked out the following morning to travel onwards to Kandy which really didn't give us enough time to appreciate this beautiful hotel!  Our room was wonderful; the separate lounge area with sofa bed for our son was perfect.  We had dinner at The Veranda - a wonderful buffet with a wide selection of courses and dishes.  Breakfast in the morning was also lovely with a wide choice.  Really wish we had more time to stay and fully explore this wonderful historic hotel."}
{"text": "The night of our stay there was a wedding at the hotel -  a wonderful venue!  However, when we returned to our room following dinner, it sounded like the wedding party was taking place in our room, especially when the live band started.  We phoned the reception who told us the music finished at 11.30pm.  We asked if they had earplugs, which they didn't, but did offer to move us. This wasn't ideal at 10pm, but we moved to a suite in an older part of the hotel, away from the noise.  However, the room was cold, unwelcoming and did not have the bed required for our son.  Staff brought us blankets to make up a bed on the floor with the cushions from a sofa, which was far from ideal and we decided to move back to our original room and put up with the noise.  \rI'm not sure what the hotel can do regarding the noise when there is a wedding or an event - maybe at least let guests know, and provide earplugs!!"}
{"text": "Nice building, well located.  Excellent service at the seafood restaurant."}
{"text": "Surrounding areas are not so clean, but that has nothing to do with the hotel"}
{"text": "The general feel of the hotel is of past glories and a beautiful colonial heritage.  The breakfast buffet on the terrace was heavenly. The rooms were beautifully presented and falling asleep listening to the roar of the ocean was something everyone should experience in their lifetime.\rThe pool was lovely and deep and great for swimmers."}
{"text": "There were one or two members of staff that were on the top of their game but, in general, we found the staff surly.  I suspect this is due to the hotel's incredible history and them being used to celebrity guests.  The house cleaning staff were incredibly polite and sweet though.\rOn the Saturday a house music event was set up and when i say blasted, the music BLASTED out from around 2pm despite only 10 people being their until about 6.  There should have been volume control until people actually arrived. It ruined the day and i like housemusic. \rAlso, i had booked two sea view rooms; one was exactly what we wanted, sea facing, the other faced out to the car park and along the park alongside the sea front.  Yes, we could see the sea, but it was out of the corner of the window and the noise was predominantly traffic."}
{"text": "Can not say enough about this place. They hit the mark every time. Wonderful staff and management respecting this beautiful hotel by being the best the can be. Loved every moment. Excellent location. The best."}
{"text": "The one single thing I could say is, that like everywhere in Sri Lanka the beer could have been a touch colder."}
{"text": "The pool party made our stay unbearable. We were informed that on our second night there would be a pool party and therefore the pool would remain closed. What we were not told was that the noise, vibration and discomfort would remain for the full twelve hours, noon till midnight. We were fed up, left the hotel for several hours and came back to the torture as we had a flight to catch in the morning. I don't think i will be staying at this hotel again.\rThe staff were polite but not very knowledgeable. they had no idea how i could comment on the hotel and its services. When i asked for 2 postcards to be mailed, they simply gave me the stamps and charged me. All 5* hotels i have stayed at never charged and simply mailed the cards for me. i think the Galle Face has a lot to learn before they can be considered world class."}
{"text": "Hotel is well located near all good restaurant's. sea view was amazing. The staffs are very helpful."}
{"text": "Friday till late night could hear from the room loud music going on the main floor was annoying. Spa,gem was under renovation which was not told at booking time was disappointing."}
{"text": "Grand hotel with olde world ambience, good views"}
{"text": "The extra 30% tax/service charges should have been disclosed up front - turns a $60 bottle of wine into an $80 one, the same goes for the room charge. No need to hide it and booking.com should consider that too as can be described as estimates. Shower had only one setting - boiling - the tap made no difference."}
{"text": "Staff is good , selection of food"}
{"text": "Room we were staying rather old fashion timber design\rWe prefer more modern room\rDoors are quite heavy to open\rDoor key holewas rather low to open\rIroning board was too low to iron"}
{"text": "Definitely the breakfast was the best of our Galle Face experience.  A spectacular choice of fresh products from all over the world. The location is wonderful right in front of the beach. Great service as well. It is worth a 8 score just for that!"}

{"text": "Fitness and spa were under construction during our stay (6th to 7th of May) so could not use them. Would have been better for a perfect five star hotel to have notified us at check in and maybe even give a small discount. Because our room was above the spa we heard loud drilling sounds for a half hour around 4:30 pm (which happened to be during our afternoon nap). Would also have been better to warn us in front and give us a choice for another room in case we would might some drilling sounds."}

{"text": "I had very clearly stated to Booking.Com and a separate mail was also sent to the property that I will be paying in cash and in the local currency. Inspite of this I was charged the $ tariff which is much higher than the tariff for local currency payment. I do not think that this is right."}
{"text": "Sitting amongst the newer high rise hotels in Colombo, Galle Face Hotel still maintains its colonial character. The staff are immensely friendly and couldn't do enough for you and they take great pride in their jobs and the hotel. The pool is lovely! Although I somehow got it into my head that it was an inifinity pool, I was still pleasantly surprised! And the cocktails by the poolside were an added bonus.... particularly with the happy hour!! The breakfast was the best buffet breakfast I have ever had with a great selection of both continental, English and Sri Lankan choices! Oh and the fact that champers is included I was in my element! I thoroughly recommend the evening buffet too. Again, great selection cooked to a high standard. The rooms, although a little small, were still very comfortable."}

We arrived just after the terrible news on Colombo and despite having army personnel around the hotel, the staff were so amazing at making us feel safe and at ease.

We did not use the hotel's cars which would have cost $70 to the airport and instead used  Kangroo Cabs which cost 3000 rupees."}
{"text": "For what we paid, I was expecting a nicer room. Although we got one of the cheapest rooms, we still paid \u00a3165 a night for a basic room and breakfast - with a view over a unused courtyard and building which had paint peeling off its walls. \r We had stayed in much nicer rooms throughout our stay, but I understand that you are paying for the location and to stay in a piece of history. \rOne night we went to the hotels Cuban restaurant, My partner is vegan and even though vegan options were given, the food was bland and tasteless and we ended up spending \u00a328 for 4 small plates and 2 mock-tails. I would not recommend eating there!"}

{"text": "Nothing to dislike."}
{"text": "The staff. The welcome and check in process. Having complimentary minibar items and welcome snacks. The happy hour snacks were delicious. The ocean view from the room along with the sound of waves crashing on the property's beach. The outside seating area of the restaurants by the beach. The suite size. The TV was big."}

We stayed for one night on our way back home and we really regreted not staying there longer.\rThe staff are AMAZING - welcoming, helpful, discreet. You truly feel the luxury and the tradition of quality. This hotel is a city within a city - there are so many things you can do - 4 amazing restaurants, splendid front line sea view pool with salt water, bars with an exciting selection of drinks, spa area, museum (how crazy is that?!:)), wime cellar.. \rSpecial thanks to the manager who gave us an upgrade and a complimentary early check-in. \rWe were surprised that the hotel managed to overcome our expectations! Will definitely stay again."}

{"text": "Everything about this beautiful hotel is perfect. The staff are wonderful. The breakfast is superb and the atmosphere/buildings are excellent. I will always return here when I come back to Colombo!"}
{"text": "The location right on the water is stunning.  It was lovely to sit by the pool and overlook the ocean and have the waves crashing right there.  It doesn't get much more beautiful than this.  It is also very close to any restaurant or site you want to visit in Colombo.  The buffet breakfast was also quite delicious.  The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay."}
{"text": "Galla Face is a total refuge from the chaos that is Columbo. Lovely setting and sunset views, kind and very attentive staff, very good food - breakfast will be an abiding memory of our trip. The hotel is old school elegance and calm. It\u2019s a big place but never feels frenetic or over busy. You feel slightly like you\u2019re in an episode of Jewel in the Crown - a real experience and we were delighted to top and tail our Sri Lanka trip here."}

{"text": "It was a very different experience of living in old colonial hotel on the coast of a bustling city of Colombo.  I did not have too much opportunity to explore the city (I only saw if from the window of the car going to work), instead I took the time to explore the hotel itself and it was an adventure.  For those of you who enjoy historical places, this hotel has a lot to offer!  It is worth to talk to the staff members about the history of the place an some slightly quirky rituals that the guests will surely witness :).   Even if the hotel itself is over 150 years old, it offeres all modern facilities.  I greatly appreciated the fact that the rooms are equipped with old-fashioned ceiling fans as well as the air conditioning.   This way I had a choice not to use the later and still stay cool in the room.  The breakfast buffet is excellent with a large choice of diverse dishes - both local, Western and also some Oriental.   Overally it is a good hotel for those, who want to stay in a place which is differnet from the modern Western style business hotels."}
{"text": "Beautiful old colonial hotels. Great facilities, lovely big pool. Nice pool bar and Cuban restaurant. Drinks quite pricey compared to other hotels we stayed at in Sri Lanka.\nHuge bedroom."}

{"text": "The ambience of the historic past, the building, the rooms, the location - all great"}
{"text": "Many groups of tourists, and the fact that the hotel misses a few \u2018younger\u2019 propositions - Cuban bar a good start... terrace area, long room can do with more of the same.... how can you make the hotel more interesting for younger  clientele?!\n"}
{"text": "Again an old colonial style hotel . Rooms we stayed in were tired and a bit rough around the edges, I believe they are in the process of updating the rooms.\rWith tax and service charge added on , prices for drinks, spa treatments and food were similar to western hotel prices. Nice salt water pool.Pool bar area good for watching sunsets, Sri Lankan piper announces sunset , and sri lankan flag  lowered overnight.\rGood breakfast buffets."}
{"text": "Some mildew and fungus on wood in bathroom ,  manager told us  he would move us, but hotel full . Didn\"t here any more from him and remained in same room. However they did scrape above off the wood !"}
{"text": "There was a fantastic welcome as we arrived in the morning the staff went out of their way to get our room ready earlier so we didn't have to wait until check in. Everyone was very friendly and provided fantastic customer service, nothing was too much trouble. Thank you for making the start of my holiday in Sri Lanka one to remember."}

Gin and tonic on the beachfront, a swim in the pool and a Sri Lankan curry buffet for dinner. Heaven! I never opened a door the whole time I stayed there. Staff were very attentive and friendly."}
{"text": "There was not a single thing to complain about."}

{"text": "The lunch wasn\u2019t great "}
{"text": "A historical and traditional hotel, beautiful place and wondelful property. The renovation is made very well, they have not destroyed the feeling of the palace. The room was big and well equipped. The staff is professional. We got very good dinners in the special restaurants and the selection of wines is huge."}
{"text": "We had to wait more than half an hour before we got the room even that we arrived after 2 in the afternoon. They just forgot us sitting on the sofa. The buffetrestaurant is too big and restless, it was not nice to have at least breakfast there."}
{"text": "We were very impressed with the check-in service. We arrived slightly early and were able to check-in after a short wait. The hotel is beautiful, in a perfect sea-front location and feels like stepping back into a long-gone colonial era. The room (junior suite) was beautifully appointed with two sea-view balconies, a feature jacuzzi bath and very comfortable bed."}
{"text": "Unfortunately we were disappointed by the restaurant experience. We were staying at the hotel to mark a special occasion and I had made a dinner reservation at the Verandah at the time of booking. Upon arriving at the restaurant we were informed that it was buffet only that night (no a la carte) due to a private function in another restaurant. I felt the hotel could have communicated this at the time of booking, which would have given me the opportunity to make alternative arrangements. It also created issues for bathroom use as the usual bathrooms were off limits due to the private function, so we had to go up to L1 for the bathroom, which caused a further inconvenience to us and was disruptive to our special dinner. I felt the hotel prioritized the private function at the expense of other guests' experience, and I have to say this is not what I expected from this hotel. In addition, the buffet itself was not great, so what was supposed to be a special evening was a disappointment."}
{"text": "Love the location by the sea. Friendly staff. Amazing breakfast buffet.  Great massage at the spa."}
{"text": "Was offered a rubbish room with noisy road outside. I was upgraded after a little time so it worked out ok in the end."}
{"text": "This beautiful, stylish hotel had no faults in my opinion; the restaurants and bars are diverse and excellent, the staff are charming and helpful, the building is magnificent  and even the small museum (housing, aming other things The Duke of Edinburgh's first ever car!). The museum also lists some of the previous guests at the hotel, including Cole Porter, Mark Twain, Noel Coward, Laurenve Olivier, Duke Ellington and Scarlett Johansson.  There's not much to be said for Colombo, so it's just as well that you feel like hanging around the hotel all day!"}

{"text": "No view whatsoever from bedroom.\rSlow service in bar area during lunch time. Quality of food served during the various buffet services and the seating ambiance of the restaurant could be much better."}

{"text": "Our stay was to short."}
{"text": "This hotel is over 150 years old and it is well reflected in the overal ambience.  For travellers who like hotels with the difference, it is a very pleasant experience.   Even a tour around the hotel is like sightseeing.   I also liked the location.  Right by the sea [althought the beach is not large], a great position to watch sunsets.  It is also close to a busy city promenade where you can immerse yourself in Colombo's life, so different from the slightly posh atmosphere of the hotel.\rBreakfast it very good.  A wide range - local and European food.  Very fresh and tasty.  Meals are served on the verandah which allows to feel the warmth and sea breeze.   Hotel has few bars, including a latino bar with life music.  The rooms have fans as well as air conditioners.  Fans are bit noisy sometimes, but for those who can't stand air conditioning this is a good alternative.  Staff is very helpful and patient.  Like everywhere in Sri Lanka.  Overall, definitely a very pleasant experience."}

{"text": "Everything you\u2019d expect to find in an historic hotel like this. Staff amazing, great facilities, room well presented and restaurants/bar good too. Enjoyed our stay!"}
{"text": "Unfortunately some ants had made there way into the mini bar, but this was quickly rectified by house keeping and the contents replaced (so not really an issue). "}
{"text": "I\u2019m struggling to think of positives. The hotel was ok, nothing special stands out."}
{"text": "The waiting staff were sometimes attentive and other times completely ignored you. It was really hit and miss. We stayed in 8 other hotels during our tour of Sri Lanka and experienced far better service elsewhere.\nThe food is overpriced and mediocre. Again we had much better food elsewhere on our Sri Lankan travels for less than half the price.\nThe pool is small for a hotel of this size and there are not enough sun beds.\nThe room appeared clean at first glance, but look again and you can see that the rug hadn\u2019t been hovered etc.\nWe could also hear noises from outside which disturbed our sleep.\nWe will look to book elsewhere next time we are in Colombo and I would advise you do the same. I couldn\u2019t recommend this hotel."}

The staff are plentiful and accommodating, food is good and there are a number of restaurants to choose from, breakfast was an extensive buffet featuring european and Sri Lankan dishes.  We used the hotel three times as a base in Colombo on our trip and would use it again"}
{"text": "One of the rooms we stayed in, while having great views, was situated above a bar which played music late at night.  On the plus side, when we complained to the management about our disturbed night, they acted promptly to ensure that we were given a quiet room for our next night at the hotel."}

{"text": "Since last year I feel it had gone down hill . They kindly upgraded my room so no complaints but glad only there one night as view over back and roof tops and room nothing to pontificate about , so no major advantage ,whereas before I had a view over sea, front and Galle face green. Also little things like soap dish chipped in bathroom, lighting not great. Breakfast buffet deteriorated , choice more limited and had run out of emmental cheese which one doesn\u2019t expect of hotel of this calibre No idea about dinner buffet . Dined at Cuban restaurant instead but sad seaspray had gone. Overall seems a bit scruffy compared to my previous stays."}

The Royal Dutch suite was truly luxurious with views over the water, and the complimentary chocolates to recognise wedding anniversary, as well as upgrade to access pre-dinner champagne and canapes in the Long Room, while watching a beautiful sunset was truly memorable. The swimming pool and pool service was second to none. The Library is well worth a visit too. Wished we could have stayed longer..."}

{"text": "Colonial history, design and location. Cuban restaurant was excellent and great fun with excellent staff"}
{"text": "The evening we were there there was a major corporate event which dominated the main ding area and bar area. The majority of the terrace was closed to residents and the music was over bearing and far too intrusive.\rIt is quite simply that paying guest enjoyment should be compromised in this way. We should have been warned and the room rate reduced as we were unable to use all the facilities advertised and the event took over the whole outside area.\rThe outside bar area lacks atmosphere and just doesn't feel right when it should be brilliant. More thought is needed on the detail to create a truly colonial feel.\rI do not think buffet service for Dinner in the main terrace restaurant is what one expects of a international hotel. Bit like being at a Club Med resort."}

{"text": "The old world charm but still new looking."}

{"text": "Fabulous location and a very comfortable and stylish hotel.  Works as a place to relax as well as visit the city."}
{"text": "The reception desk were a bit unwelcoming - it was sunset and the hotel has a tradition of 'piping' down the sun which is fun to view.  Our receptionist messed around and never said 'welcome' and we pretty much missed it.  Poor training for a hotel of such quality, but I stress that wasnt true of all the reception staff."}
{"text": "Location - you can walk nearly to every landmark in the city. \nThe swimming pool nearly at the beach. \nChoice of restaurants and bars (yet the speed of service could be improved, especiallly at King of the Mambo!)\nFriendly and helpfull staff!\nYou should try the spa offer, especially the massage (ask for firm tratment and leave really relaxed)"}
{"text": "Room was rather loud, mainly due to not sound proofed doors, with a lot of noises coming from the corridor - source were guests but also housekeeping employees, active early morning (6-8 AM) - we couldn\u2019t sleep well\nBad smell as a result of humidity (in the room and some of the public spaces)\nThe price of airport pick-up / drop-off servcie is above average (even comparing to the Blacklane package of comparable car standard)"}
{"text": "Location is very central and unique as the garden is directly on the seafront (most other main hotels are separated by the main road). The swimming pool is spacious (40 m) & uses sea water.

{"text": "Has so much potential to be a great hotel. However the building is run down, customer service staff have very little concept on what they are doing and at times rude and unhelpful. Food selection in restaurants was poor. Seems to cater for a primarily middle age British holiday maker demographic with pre purchased holiday packages.\rAlso had an awful experience with some missing jewellery that had been delivered for us from another hotel.

If they\u2019d told me that 8 months in advance I would have cancelled the booking.  Ended up being a disaster of a two night stay and they didn\u2019t seem to care at all.  Rooms are old and tired with archaic control systems.  Staff were nice but service was agonisingly slow even by Sri Lankan standards.  Terrible value for money compared to other hotels in the city, you\u2019re paying for the history of the place more than anything else."}
{"text": "For historians a delight this old and famous hotel. Some of the rituals (such as an unusual ceremony every sunset) were very enjoyable."}
{"text": "The rooms' bathroom needed some maintenance, but upon return to the hotel some days later all were very apologetic and a free upgrade was granted."}
{"text": "The colonial charm of the hotel and its location overlooking the ocean, which was perfect for watching sunsets. Also, the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. A bonus was the quality and variety of food served at the buffets."}

{"text": "Noise. Wooden floors and noisy people in the room upstairs meant I was woken at 1.15am on the first night and a party until 2.30am on the second night led to bad nights sleep. The spa was a bit disorganised and deep tissue massage was not deep tissue and not very good. \nAvoid if you want to sleep. I checked out a day early and management response was pretty poor. "}

It\u2019s not that special experience I hoped to get."}
{"text": "Staff were very friendly but not overly helpful. Swimming pool was amazing. The pool bar is also great for snacks and drinks almost any time of day. \nThe building itself is just gorgeous. The galle face green is right next door and is a great spot to take in a sunset and sea breeze. \nThe fort district is only a short walk and there is a shopping mall across the road. "}
{"text": "The room wasn't as clean as it could have been. A pair of false eyelashes left in the shower were waiting for us the first time we used it. \nWe called reception three times for assistance we never did receive. \nPrice gouging when leaving. Don't ask for a taxi they will provide the hotel car for more than double the price of an actual taxi. Take an uber using the hotels Wi-Fi instead. "}
{"text": "The whole hotel is an experience from beginning to end. Just walking around this beautiful hotel is like sight seeing in museum.  Their traditions such as the 6 oclock piper from the hotel to the shore, the two weddings we were lucky enough to watch.  All perfect.  Just one little problem.  The door between rooms (locked) did nothing to stop the noise next door.  We could hear teaspoons clinking, conversations, etc.  Luckily for us we had two considerate neighbours.  Not sure how that noise could be reduced.  Guess next time I would definitely ask for a room with no shared door.  However this is a beautiful hotel , on an amazing point of land in Colombo so make sure to go there (and ask for a room without door)"}
{"text": "Only the shared door probem"}
{"text": "We returned to this fabulous colonial oasis after 36 years and it was more wonderful than before. The hotel is charming and is a reminder of a bygone era.  The staff are very much up to date about the importance of friendly, efficient service and are able to communicate extremely well with travellers from all over the world. A smile goes a long way and there are certainly many of those from the hotel staff.  The restaurants, bar, pool, museum and grounds are top notch and make for a very romantic interlude in a very busy city.  My husband and I highly recommend The Galle Face Hotel."}

{"text": "The room was a bit small.  We had an ocean view room with balcony but the cushions on the outside chairs were filled with rain water and there were no towels to use the outside lounges (though they soon arrived when requested).  The fridge did not work very well."}
{"text": "The hotel was in a great location and had a lot of charm,  The staff were great - especially those who welcomed us on our arrival at 3am!"}
{"text": "Just outside the door to our room were all the spare beds/mattresses.  This was not a good look."}
{"text": "Beautiful property which is built ON the beach, so you can hear the waves from almost everywhere in the hotel. So it gives you an unmatched resort vibe while still being located in the heart of Colombo city. They have preserved the grand heritage of the hotel very appropriately, we stayed in a 42 Sq.m junior suite with a huge private balcony facing the ocean. It doesn\u2019t get better than that."}
{"text": "The staff were a little lazy. People didn\u2019t offer to help with luggage on both instances which was very surprising to me. The food also was acceptable but not a smack out of the park as one would have expected at a big 5 star in Colombo. Afternoon high tea at the veranda must be the most beautiful tea spot in Colombo. However the tea choices were disgraceful. Air conditioning in the room could have been a little more powerful, I suspect like most hotels they reduced the airflow between 2-5am."}
{"text": "What can one say about the Galleface Hotel that has not being previously said. This is an exceptional hotel and everything about it oozes five star. It should be on every traveller's itinerary to spend at least a couple of days at this hotel. We will be back."}
{"text": "Breakfast. "}
{"text": "The room was very small and bathroom doors had problem. Not value for money. Had stayed here earlier, was given a better room. Not idle for old people and people on wheel chairs. "}
{"text": "Great spot great pool and nice bar and restaurant "}
{"text": "Not really value for the money you pay compared to other places. Concierge service not overly helpful"}
{"text": "Balcony suite was wonderful & breakfasts excellent. Nanna wonderful breakfast manager"}
{"text": "External paintwork was in a poor state especially front of building. Selection of drinks at happy hour in long bar was poor. If you are going to have a happy hour then make it a real happy hour otherwise I would have preferred to see the piping of the flag down at the main bar downstairs. Small front beach contained a lot of plastic litter that should be the responsibility of the pool attendant to clear every day. I picked up a lot but without a bin in sight all I could do was inappropriately give it to the breakfast bar attendant."}
{"text": "Wonderful old colonial charm to the hotel! Staff was friendly and accommodating and the food was delicious! They even surprised us with champagne in our room for our honeymoon!"}
{"text": "The superior style rooms have very thin walls so you can hear everything in the next room."}
{"text": "The hotel staff were verry attentive. Great pool. The rooms very comfortable and the daily breakfast second to none. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone."}
{"text": "Stay at this hotel for a sense of grandeur and history. It feels a little like going back in time, in a good way. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite, which was about the size of a London flat, and very comfortable. Everything was polite and professional."}
{"text": "No complaints."}
{"text": "Excellent location. Spacious rooms. We were upgraded to junior suite. Had a seaview and view of pool deck. There is so much history and tradition at this hotel. The small museum is a must visit. There is also tours of the hotel on certain days. "}
{"text": "Nothing not to like. Staff at the Verandah restaurant were so helpful but we ate at pool restaurant one night and found the staff unhelpful. They need to up their game to match the other areas of the hotel."}
{"text": "Great room with a view, we were upgraded and also had a cake waiting in our room as it was my birthday. This was a very kind touch which was much appreciated.good location to have a drink and watch the sunset as well.\rBeautifully preserved features in the hotel, classic compared to many of the more bland modern hotels nearby."}
{"text": "There was an event taking place on the chequerboard/area in front of the bar/restaurant and by the beach the night we stayed. We were not informed of this in advance or when we checked in and you could hear everything through the windows as our room overlooked it. That would have been ok as it finished reasonably early but the crew then started  to dismantle all of the props and metal structures that were in place for it. They woke us around 12.30 with the noise from doing this as they took no care to do this quietly. They continued doing this until after 2.30 am (I don\u2019t know when it stopped!) as I eventually fell asleep then (with ear plugs on!). I didn\u2019t ring down as I kept thinking that surely the hotel staff would see and hear what was going on. Also, they obviously wanted them to dismantle it that night rather than next morning so I don\u2019t think calling down would have made any difference as I doubt it would have been stopped just for us. It seems such an odd thing to do at that time of night in the first instance. If we had been informed in advance of this event, I would have asked for a different room.\rWhen we checked out, we weren\u2019t asked how everything was but I did bring this up and the manager was called. They were very apologetic and offered an upgrade if we stayed again but couldn\u2019t do that as we said we were leaving Colombo. They then gave us 2 bottles of water..\rIt was a shame as it is a lovely hotel but due to being older, there is capacity for a lot of noise through the windows and under doors at night. I would perhaps return if I was in Colombo but not anywhere near the busier parts of the hotel and I do not think it is worth some of the rates that were quoted on booking.com (we got it last minute for c\u00a3100 which was ok). We stayed in Paradise Road Tintagel the 2 nights before and found it much more relaxing, calm and very professional staff."}

{"text": "Nothing"}
{"text": "The staff were most helpful and welcoming. The room was very well appointed and the views great. The breakfast s\u00e9lection was good. "}
{"text": "The coffee was not good. "}
{"text": "Beautiful colonial hotel; we stayed in a Junior Suite with an ocean view balcony, absolutely magnificent room. We ate in the 1864 restaurant and the meal was faultless. Thoroughly enjoyable 48 hour relax at the end of our holiday - we\u2019ll be back one day. "}
{"text": "Faultless but a word of warning - we were able to book an airport taxi for \u00a34K (local currency) less than the hotel service offered - look locally!"}
{"text": "Beautiful building with fabulous salt water swimming pool and views out to sea.\rLovely room with view over the Green. Good breakfast."}
{"text": "I was asked on way out if I was checking out because I did not come from reception desk. It was not a pleasant ending"}
{"text": "Location was good."}
{"text": "The staff were not very attentive. Very inconsistent with training as there seemed to be no standard. The staff did not wear their uniform with pride.  I choose the hotel based on its history and location. I expected the staff to be better. Hotel interior needs a good refurb. I would not recommend to others as there are many better close by."}
{"text": "The range of restaurants and their beautiful settings. Loved the location on the waterfront. Magnificent pool. \rThe staff were very helpful and attentive. \rBeautiful colonial building and peaceful atmosphere."}
{"text": "Nothing."}
{"text": "Amazing old property refurbished right on the sea. Hotel has a great history and a museum inside.Great central location. You can spend hours in the coffeeshop looking at the sea!!!\nMine was a short stay so i cannot comment on the food but looked like a huge spread .Excellent staff. Very caring. I fell down outside the hotel and was hurt. Quick medication and manager himself came to see me and called few hours later to ask if i needed anything. Bellboy   smiled in greeting when he came to pick up my bags even   as early as  2.30 am  in the morning."}
{"text": "There was nothing not to like.."}
{"text": "We were upgraded, so possibly not the most objective review, but the hotel itself is just beautiful, with the colonial architecture preserved and accentuated. The staff we excellent and the food (we only had breakfast buffet) very good."}
{"text": "The pool is sea water. It's warm though."}
{"text": "The hotel has a great atmosphere - really takes you back in time. Also level of service is very high. Great romantic place for a couple"}
{"text": "N/A - we had fantastic time"}
